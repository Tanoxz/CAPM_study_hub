  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "tq_001",
      "question": "A project manager is starting a small, low-risk internal project. The organization has a comprehensive project management methodology with many required artifacts. What should the PM do?",
      "options": [
        "Follow the full methodology exactly as documented",
        "Tailor the methodology to fit the project's size and risk level",
        "Skip the methodology entirely since it's a small project",
        "Ask the sponsor to exempt the project from all processes"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Tailoring is the deliberate adaptation of approaches to fit the project context. A small, low-risk project doesn't need the same rigor as a large, complex one. The PM should tailor, not abandon, the methodology.",
      "knowledge_area": "Tailoring",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "question_type": "scenario"
    },
    {
      "id": "tq_002",
      "question": "What is the PRIMARY purpose of tailoring in project management?",
      "options": [
        "To reduce documentation requirements",
        "To align the approach with the project's environment and objectives",
        "To make projects easier to manage",
        "To standardize all projects across the organization"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Tailoring aligns the project management approach with the project's specific environment and objectives. It's not about reducing work or standardizing - it's about optimizing the approach for the context.",

      "difficulty": "easy",
      "question_type": "concept"
    },
    {
      "id": "tq_003",
      "question": "A construction project involves building a data center. The physical construction is well-defined, but the computing requirements are still evolving. Which approach is MOST appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "Use a purely predictive approach for the entire project",
        "Use a purely adaptive approach for the entire project",
        "Use a hybrid approach - predictive for construction, adaptive for computing",
        "Wait until all requirements are known before starting"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "A hybrid approach matches the development approach to the nature of the work. Construction with well-defined requirements suits predictive; evolving computing requirements suit adaptive.",

        "Adding more oversight to ensure quality",
        "Granting higher levels of empowerment and decision-making authority",
        "Requiring more detailed status reports",
        "Implementing stricter process controls"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Tailoring engagement involves matching empowerment to team capability. Experienced, self-organizing teams thrive with more autonomy. Adding oversight would be counterproductive.",

    {
      "id": "tq_007",
      "question": "An organization has a low risk appetite and operates in a heavily regulated industry. When tailoring, the PM should expect:",
      "options": [
        "Complete freedom to choose any development approach",
        "More structured processes and oversight mechanisms",
        "Minimal documentation requirements",
        "Highly autonomous project teams"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Organizations with low risk appetite and regulatory requirements typically implement structured processes and oversight. This limits tailoring flexibility but ensures compliance and control.",

        "Scope creep",
        "Non-compliance",
        "Process tailoring",
        "Risk avoidance"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Removing process elements that don't add value is a legitimate tailoring activity. The key is that it's a deliberate decision based on project context, not negligence.",
