      "question": "A team is working on a complex software project where requirements are expected to change frequently. The customer wants to see progress regularly and provide feedback. Which development approach is most appropriate?",
      "options": [
        "Predictive approach with detailed upfront planning",
        "Adaptive/Agile approach with iterative delivery",
        "Hybrid approach starting predictive then switching to agile",
        "Sequential approach with formal change control"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Adaptive/Agile approaches are designed for high-uncertainty work where requirements evolve. Frequent delivery of working increments enables customer feedback and course correction - exactly what this scenario needs.",

      "question": "During a Sprint Review, stakeholders request a significant new feature. What should the Scrum Team do?",
      "options": [
        "Add it immediately to the current sprint",
        "Reject it since the sprint backlog is frozen",
        "Have the Product Owner add it to the Product Backlog for prioritization",
        "Schedule an emergency planning session"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "New requests go to the Product Backlog, where the Product Owner prioritizes them against other work. The Sprint Backlog is set during Sprint Planning; changes during the sprint disrupt focus and commitment.",

    },
    {
      "id": "agile_q003",
      "question": "A Scrum Master notices the Development Team is consistently waiting for the Product Owner to clarify requirements. What is the BEST action?",
      "options": [
        "Tell the team to make assumptions and proceed",
        "Escalate to senior management",
        "Facilitate better backlog refinement sessions",
        "Assign a team member to act as backup Product Owner"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Scrum Master's role is to remove impediments and improve processes. Better backlog refinement ensures stories are ready BEFORE Sprint Planning, addressing the root cause rather than symptoms.",

      "question": "Which Agile Manifesto value is demonstrated when a team delivers a working product increment rather than extensive documentation?",
      "options": [
        "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools",
        "Working software over comprehensive documentation",
        "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation",
        "Responding to change over following a plan"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Working software over comprehensive documentation means prioritizing deliverables that provide value. Documentation has value but should not delay or replace actual working product.",

      "question": "A Kanban team has a column with 8 items waiting while the next column has 2 items being worked on. What does this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "The team is highly productive",
        "There is a bottleneck creating a backlog",
        "WIP limits are working correctly",
        "The team needs more resources"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Items piling up in one column while the next column has capacity indicates a bottleneck. This flow problem needs to be addressed - perhaps by having upstream team members help with the constraint.",

      "question": "What is the PRIMARY purpose of the Daily Scrum?",
      "options": [
        "For the Scrum Master to assign tasks",
        "To report status to management",
        "For the Development Team to synchronize and plan for the day",
        "To update the Product Backlog priorities"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Daily Scrum is for the Development Team to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as needed. It's a synchronization meeting, not a status report to management.",

    {
      "id": "agile_q007",
      "question": "A team has completed their sprint work early. What should they do with the remaining time?",
      "options": [
        "End the sprint early and start the next one",
        "Take time off until the sprint ends",
        "Pull more work from the Product Backlog",
        "Extend the Definition of Done"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "If the sprint goal is met early, the team can pull additional items from the Product Backlog in consultation with the Product Owner. Sprints are fixed-length; ending early disrupts rhythm.",

      "options": [
        "The Scrum Master makes decisions for the team to save time",
        "The Product Owner serves the customers by writing detailed specifications",
        "Leaders focus on removing impediments and enabling team success",
        "The Development Team serves management by meeting deadlines"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Servant leadership means serving the team's needs - removing obstacles, coaching, facilitating - rather than commanding. The goal is creating an environment where self-organizing teams can succeed.",

      "question": "A team using XP practices discovers a bug in code written two months ago. What practice would have caught this sooner?",
      "options": [
        "Pair programming",
        "Continuous integration with automated testing",
        "Sprint retrospectives",
        "Product backlog refinement"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Continuous integration with automated testing catches bugs when they're introduced, not months later. The faster feedback loop of CI/CD dramatically reduces the cost and effort of fixing defects.",

      "id": "agile_q010",
      "question": "WHY do agile teams prefer face-to-face conversation for conveying information?",
      "options": [
        "It's faster than writing documentation",
        "It's the most efficient and effective method for sharing information",
        "Documentation can be misinterpreted",
        "Agile doesn't allow written communication"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Agile Principle #6 states face-to-face conversation is 'the most efficient and effective method.' It enables immediate clarification, non-verbal cues, and builds relationships - though documentation still has its place.",

      "question": "A Sprint Retrospective reveals that integration issues consistently delay the team. What should happen next?",
      "options": [
        "Document the issue for next quarter's planning",
        "The team commits to a specific improvement action for the next sprint",
        "Escalate to the PMO for resource allocation",
        "Add buffer time to future sprint estimates"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Retrospectives should lead to actionable improvements. The team should identify a specific experiment to try next sprint (e.g., more frequent integration, pair programming during integration).",

    {
      "id": "agile_q012",
      "question": "What distinguishes a high-performing agile team from a traditional team?",
      "options": [
        "They never miss deadlines",
        "They require less management oversight",
        "They are self-organizing and continuously improving",
        "They have more senior developers"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "High-performing agile teams are self-organizing (decide HOW to do work) and committed to continuous improvement through retrospectives. This produces ownership and innovation that traditional command-and-control can't match.",

      "id": "agile_q013",
      "question": "A Product Owner is unavailable for several days. What impact does this have?",
      "options": [
        "None - the team can work from the existing backlog",
        "The team cannot make progress",
        "Decisions about scope and priority may be delayed",
        "The Scrum Master should assume PO responsibilities"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "While the team can continue working on committed items, questions about acceptance criteria, priorities, and new requests will be delayed. The PO's availability is crucial for agility.",

      "question": "What is the main purpose of WIP limits in Kanban?",
      "options": [
        "To prevent team members from being overworked",
        "To improve flow by limiting work-in-progress",
        "To ensure equal distribution of tasks",
        "To track individual productivity"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "WIP limits expose bottlenecks and improve flow. When a column hits its limit, the team must help clear it before pulling new work - this is the 'stop starting, start finishing' philosophy.",

    {
      "id": "agile_q015",
      "question": "During Sprint Planning, the Development Team realizes they cannot commit to all the items the Product Owner wants. What should happen?",
      "options": [
        "The team should work overtime to fit everything in",
        "The Product Owner should reduce scope or reprioritize",
        "The sprint length should be extended",
        "Lower priority items should be done with less quality"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The team commits only to what they can realistically complete. The PO decides which items are most important if scope must be reduced. Quality is never compromised for scope.",

      "id": "agile_q016",
      "question": "Which statement about the Definition of Done is TRUE?",
      "options": [
        "It can change from sprint to sprint based on what's needed",
        "It applies to the whole increment, not individual items",
        "It should be consistent and applied to all work equally",
        "It's defined by the Product Owner"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Definition of Done must be consistent - all work is held to the same quality standard. Varying the DoD hides technical debt and creates unpredictable quality.",

        "Lean is a subset of agile approaches",
        "They are completely unrelated"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Agile and Kanban are subsets of lean thinking. Lean provides the philosophy (eliminate waste, optimize flow, respect people) while agile provides specific practices for applying those principles.",

        "Scrumban",
        "Lean-Agile",
        "Adaptive Scrum"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Scrumban combines Scrum's structure (sprints, roles, events) with Kanban's flow practices (visualization, WIP limits). It's a common hybrid for teams wanting more flexibility than pure Scrum.",
