      "question": "A project team is about to start development, but stakeholders have different understandings of what problem they're solving. What should the Business Analyst do FIRST?",
      "options": [
        "Start gathering requirements from each stakeholder",
        "Facilitate creation of a Situation Statement",
        "Begin designing the solution architecture",
        "Create a project schedule"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "A Situation Statement ensures all stakeholders agree on the problem before jumping to solutions. Without shared understanding of the problem, requirements will conflict and the solution may miss the mark.",

    {
      "id": "ba_q002",
      "question": "A stakeholder defines a project objective as 'improve customer satisfaction.' What should the Business Analyst recommend?",
      "options": [
        "Accept it and begin elicitation",
        "Make it SMART by adding specific, measurable criteria",
        "Reject it as too vague",
        "Assign a satisfaction metric internally"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "SMART objectives (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) enable clear success criteria. 'Improve customer satisfaction by 15% in 6 months as measured by NPS' is actionable.",

      "question_type": "scenario"
    },
    {
      "id": "ba_q003",
      "question": "When conducting stakeholder interviews, users describe their current process very differently from what you observe during job shadowing. What does this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "Users are being dishonest",
        "The observation was conducted at an atypical time",
        "There's a gap between stated and actual processes",
        "The interview questions were poorly designed"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "People often can't articulate tacit knowledge - they do things automatically. Observation reveals workarounds and actual behaviors that interviews miss. Both techniques are valuable together.",

      "question_type": "scenario"
    },
    {
      "id": "ba_q004",
      "question": "What is the PRIMARY purpose of a Requirements Traceability Matrix?",
      "options": [
        "To track project costs",
        "To link requirements from origin through delivery",
        "To assign requirements to team members",
        "To document requirement change history"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The RTM traces requirements from business need → stakeholder requirement → solution requirement → design → test. This ensures nothing is missed and provides impact analysis for changes.",

    {
      "id": "ba_q005",
      "question": "A customer requests a feature during development. The team can build it, but it wasn't in the original scope. What should happen?",
      "options": [
        "Build it since the customer is always right",
        "Reject it to avoid scope creep",
        "Assess impact and follow change control process",
        "Add it to a future release without assessment"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Change requests need impact analysis (cost, schedule, risk) before decision. Neither automatic acceptance nor rejection is appropriate - the change might add value or might not be worth the cost.",

        "Replaces the need for user testing",
        "Identifies all possible users"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Personas make abstract user groups concrete. 'Sara, the tech-savvy first-time homebuyer' is more actionable than 'the user.' Teams design better when they can empathize with specific people.",

      "question": "A defect is found after deployment. Root cause analysis reveals unclear requirements. Using the 5 Whys, what should the BA investigate?",
      "options": [
        "Who wrote the requirements",
        "Why the requirements were unclear and what process failed",
        "Which developer made the mistake",
        "When the defect was introduced"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "5 Whys digs into systemic causes, not blame. The question is: Why unclear? → Not reviewed → Why? → No review process → ROOT CAUSE. Fixing the process prevents recurrence.",

      "options": [
        "Business requirements are for executives; solution requirements are for developers",
        "Business requirements define WHY; solution requirements define WHAT and HOW",

        "Business requirements come first; solution requirements replace them"

      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Business requirements state organizational goals (WHY we need a solution). Solution requirements specify what the solution must do (functional) and how it must perform (non-functional).",

      "options": [
        "All timeframes should have equal detail",
        "Near-term items with decreasing detail further out",
        "Long-term vision with less detail near-term",
        "Only the next release should be detailed"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Roadmaps show certainty through detail. Near-term is well understood; distant future is uncertain. Pretending to know long-term details creates false expectations. 'Now/Next/Later' format works well.",

        "Only when problems arise",
        "After all work is complete"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Go/No-Go decisions should occur at phase gates throughout the project. Conditions change; continuing a project that no longer makes business sense wastes resources. Regular checkpoints enable early termination when needed.",

      "question": "A user story states: 'As a user, I want search functionality.' What is wrong with this story?",
      "options": [
        "It's too technical",
        "It lacks the 'so that' benefit clause",
        "Users shouldn't request features",
        "Nothing - it follows the format"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'so that [benefit]' clause forces articulation of business value. Without it, we might build the wrong kind of search. The complete format ensures we understand WHY the user wants it.",

        "Normal project dynamics",
        "Incomplete stakeholder analysis",
        "The stakeholder is being difficult",
        "Requirements are always changing"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,

      "options": [
        "Written by the development team",
        "Specific, testable, and agreed upon before work begins",
        "Flexible enough to accommodate changes during development",
        "Detailed enough to specify implementation approach"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Acceptance criteria must be testable (pass/fail), agreed before work starts (contract between PO and team), and specific enough to avoid ambiguity. They define WHAT, not HOW.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "First understand the situation. The team may have discovered something during implementation, or there's a miscommunication. Understanding precedes action - it might be valid or might need correction.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The business case answers 'Why should we do this?' with cost-benefit analysis, risks, and alternatives. It justifies investment and serves as a reference throughout the project to maintain alignment.",

      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "User Acceptance Testing (UAT) validates that the solution meets business needs from the user's perspective. Technical testing (unit, integration, performance) validates the solution works; UAT validates it's the RIGHT solution.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Story mapping arranges stories along the user journey (horizontal) and by priority (vertical). This preserves context that a flat backlog loses, making it easier to define MVPs and release increments.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
