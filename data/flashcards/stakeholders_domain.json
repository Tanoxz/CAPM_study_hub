      "question": "What is a stakeholder?",
      "answer": "Any individual, group, or organization that may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by the project. This includes internal (team, sponsor) and external (customers, regulators) parties.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "The broad definition matters - 'perceive itself to be affected' means even those who THINK they're affected count. Missing a stakeholder who believes they have a stake leads to resistance.",

    },
    {
      "id": "stake_002",
      "question": "WHY is stakeholder identification done early and revisited throughout?",
      "answer": "Early identification allows engagement when stakeholders have most influence and changes are cheapest. Revisiting catches new stakeholders who emerge as the project progresses or context changes.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "why",
      "why_it_matters": "A stakeholder discovered late who should have been involved early often becomes a resistor. The cost of change increases exponentially over time - early engagement prevents costly late changes.",

    },
    {
      "id": "stake_003",
      "question": "What is a Power/Interest Grid used for?",
      "answer": "To categorize stakeholders based on their level of authority (power) and their concern about project outcomes (interest). This determines the engagement strategy for each stakeholder.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Not all stakeholders need the same attention. High power/high interest = manage closely. High power/low interest = keep satisfied. Low power/high interest = keep informed. Low power/low interest = monitor.",
      "related_concepts": ["Stakeholder Analysis", "Engagement Strategy", "Salience Model"]
    },
    {
      "id": "stake_004",
      "question": "What is the difference between Stakeholder Engagement and Communications Management?",
      "answer": "Engagement = understanding and addressing stakeholder needs, expectations, and concerns to gain support. Communications = the mechanisms, formats, and frequencies of information exchange.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "You can have excellent communications (regular updates, clear reports) but poor engagement (not addressing concerns, not building relationships). Both are needed but serve different purposes.",
      "related_concepts": ["Communications Plan", "Stakeholder Engagement Plan", "Relationship Building"]
    },
    {
      "id": "stake_005",
      "question": "WHY should negative stakeholders be engaged rather than ignored?",
      "answer": "Ignoring negative stakeholders doesn't make them go away - it lets their resistance grow unchecked. Engaging them reveals their concerns (which might be valid) and provides opportunity to convert or neutralize opposition.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "why",
      "why_it_matters": "A vocal opponent with legitimate concerns might be warning you about real problems. Even if you can't satisfy them, understanding their position helps you prepare for objections and manage risk.",

    },
    {
      "id": "stake_006",
      "question": "What are the five levels of Stakeholder Engagement?",
      "answer": "1) Unaware - doesn't know about project. 2) Resistant - opposes the project. 3) Neutral - neither supports nor opposes. 4) Supportive - backs the project. 5) Leading - actively champions the project.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "This assessment matrix shows current vs. desired engagement level. If a key stakeholder is Resistant but needs to be Supportive, that gap identifies where engagement effort is needed.",

    },
    {
      "id": "stake_007",
      "question": "WHY does the PMBOK emphasize 'tailoring' communications to stakeholders?",
      "answer": "Different stakeholders need different information in different formats. Executives want summaries; technical teams want details. Sending everyone the same report wastes time and loses attention.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "why",
      "why_it_matters": "Information overload is as bad as information scarcity. A 50-page report to an executive who needs 5 bullet points means they'll read neither. Tailored communication respects stakeholders' time.",
      "related_concepts": ["Communication Requirements", "Audience Analysis", "Information Distribution"]
    },
    {
      "id": "stake_008",
      "question": "What is a Stakeholder Register?",
      "answer": "A project document containing identification, assessment, and classification information about stakeholders. It includes names, roles, expectations, influence, and engagement strategies.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "The register is the single source of truth about stakeholders. It drives engagement planning and helps ensure no one is forgotten. Often contains sensitive information requiring controlled access.",
      "related_concepts": ["Stakeholder Identification", "Engagement Strategy", "Document Control"]
    },
    {
      "id": "stake_009",
      "question": "WHY is stakeholder engagement a two-way process, not just broadcasting?",
      "answer": "Engagement requires understanding stakeholder needs (listening), not just pushing information (telling). Feedback reveals concerns, validates understanding, and builds trust through dialogue.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "why",
      "why_it_matters": "One-way communication creates information silos. Stakeholders who feel heard are more supportive. Feedback loops catch problems early before they become crises.",
      "related_concepts": ["Active Listening", "Feedback Loops", "Two-Way Communication"]
    },
    {
      "id": "stake_010",
      "question": "What is the Project Sponsor's role regarding stakeholders?",
      "answer": "The sponsor provides support at executive level, removes organizational obstacles, secures resources, champions the project, and helps manage high-level stakeholders the PM can't reach.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "PMs often lack organizational authority. The sponsor bridges that gap - they can influence executives, secure funding, and resolve political conflicts that would block the PM.",
      "related_concepts": ["Executive Support", "Project Governance", "Escalation Path"]
    },
    {
      "id": "stake_011",
      "question": "What is the Salience Model for stakeholder analysis?",
      "answer": "A model that classifies stakeholders based on three attributes: Power (ability to influence), Legitimacy (appropriateness of involvement), and Urgency (need for immediate attention). More attributes = more salient.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Power/Interest grids miss urgency. A low-power stakeholder might suddenly become critical if they have urgent, legitimate concerns. Salience helps identify whose needs are most pressing RIGHT NOW.",
      "related_concepts": ["Stakeholder Analysis", "Power/Interest Grid", "Prioritization", "Engagement Strategy"]
    },
    {
      "id": "stake_012",
      "question": "WHY is political awareness an important PM skill?",
      "answer": "Because projects exist in organizational contexts with competing interests, hidden agendas, and power dynamics. Understanding politics helps navigate obstacles, build alliances, and avoid landmines.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "why",
      "why_it_matters": "Ignoring politics doesn't make it go away - it just means you're blindsided by it. Politically aware PMs can anticipate resistance, find allies, and frame initiatives in terms stakeholders care about.",
      "related_concepts": ["Organizational Culture", "Influence", "Coalition Building", "Change Management"]
    },
    {
      "id": "stake_013",
      "question": "What is a Communications Management Plan?",
      "answer": "A document describing how project communications will be planned, structured, implemented, and monitored. Includes who needs what information, when, how, and who provides it.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Without a plan, communication is haphazard - some get too much, others too little, wrong formats, wrong timing. The plan ensures intentional, stakeholder-appropriate information flow.",
      "related_concepts": ["Information Distribution", "Stakeholder Engagement", "Reporting", "Communication Channels"]
    },
    {
      "id": "stake_014",
      "question": "What interpersonal skills are most important for stakeholder engagement?",
      "answer": "Active listening, empathy, building trust, conflict resolution, negotiation, cultural awareness, networking, and political awareness. Technical skills get you the PM role; interpersonal skills determine success.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Projects succeed or fail based on relationships, not just plans. A PM with strong interpersonal skills can navigate resistance, build support, and resolve conflicts that would derail someone who only has technical skills.",
      "related_concepts": ["Emotional Intelligence", "Soft Skills", "Leadership", "Influence"]
    },
    {
      "id": "stake_015",
      "question": "WHY is managing upward (to sponsors and executives) different from managing the team?",
      "answer": "Because executives have different information needs (summary vs. detail), different time constraints (minutes vs. hours), and different power dynamics (you report to them). The PM must adapt style accordingly.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "why",
      "why_it_matters": "Treating executives like team members wastes their time and loses their attention. Treating team members like executives leaves them without the detail they need. Match your approach to the audience.",

    },
    {
      "id": "stake_016",
      "question": "What are common sources of conflict on projects?",
      "answer": "Schedules, priorities, resources, technical approaches, administrative procedures, cost, and personalities. Most conflict stems from competing constraints and differing perspectives on the best approach.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Knowing sources helps anticipate and prevent conflict. Resource conflicts require negotiation. Technical conflicts require collaboration. Personality conflicts require mediation. Different sources need different responses.",

    },
    {
      "id": "stake_017",
      "question": "What are the five conflict resolution styles?",
      "answer": "Withdraw/Avoid (postpone), Smooth/Accommodate (emphasize agreement), Compromise (partial satisfaction), Force/Direct (win-lose), Collaborate/Problem-Solve (win-win). Each fits different situations.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "PMI generally favors Collaborate (best long-term). But sometimes you withdraw (not worth fighting), smooth (preserve relationship), compromise (time-pressured), or force (safety/ethics). Context determines the right approach.",
      "related_concepts": ["Conflict Management", "Negotiation", "Team Dynamics", "Interpersonal Skills"]
    },
    {
      "id": "stake_018",
      "question": "WHY does trust take time to build but moments to destroy?",
      "answer": "Because trust is built through consistent demonstrated behavior over time, but a single betrayal or failure violates expectations and destroys the pattern. Rebuilding requires starting over, which skeptical stakeholders resist.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "why",
      "why_it_matters": "PMs must guard trust carefully. Overpromising and underdelivering, missing commitments, or sharing confidential information destroys relationships that took months to build. Consistency builds trust; surprises destroy it.",

    },
    {
      "id": "stake_019",
      "question": "How should stakeholder expectations be managed when they're unrealistic?",
      "answer": "Through early, honest communication about constraints; involving stakeholders in tradeoff decisions; documenting assumptions; and continuous alignment through regular touchpoints. Never hide bad news hoping it will improve.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Unrealistic expectations lead to disappointment regardless of actual performance. Proactively managing expectations creates shared understanding. Stakeholders prefer early bad news they can react to over late surprises.",

    },
    {
      "id": "stake_020",
      "question": "WHY is cultural awareness important for project stakeholder management?",
      "answer": "Because cultural differences affect communication styles, decision-making, time orientation, hierarchy expectations, and conflict approaches. What works in one culture may offend in another.",
      "knowledge_area": "Stakeholders",
      "card_type": "why",
      "why_it_matters": "Global projects cross cultural boundaries. Direct communication valued in some cultures seems rude in others. Understanding cultural dimensions (Hofstede's model, etc.) prevents misunderstandings and builds respect.",
