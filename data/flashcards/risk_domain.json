      "question": "What is a project risk?",
      "answer": "An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on project objectives. Key word: UNCERTAIN - if it's certain, it's not a risk, it's a fact.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Note risks can be POSITIVE (opportunities) not just negative (threats). Managing both maximizes project value. Also: uncertainty is the defining characteristic - certain problems aren't risks.",

    },
    {
      "id": "risk_002",
      "question": "WHY does PMI emphasize that risks can be positive?",
      "answer": "Because only managing threats is half the picture. Opportunities (positive risks) can add value, reduce costs, or accelerate schedules. Actively pursuing good uncertainties is as important as avoiding bad ones.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "why",
      "why_it_matters": "Teams that only focus on threats miss chances to exceed expectations. Example: A vendor might deliver early - that's a positive risk you could exploit to accelerate the project.",

    {
      "id": "risk_003",
      "question": "What is the difference between Individual Risk and Overall Project Risk?",
      "answer": "Individual Risk = specific uncertain event affecting objectives. Overall Project Risk = effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources including individual risks.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "You can have many small individual risks that collectively threaten the project (overall risk). Or few large individual risks. Both views needed - managing parts doesn't guarantee the whole is managed.",

    {
      "id": "risk_004",
      "question": "What are the five response strategies for THREATS (negative risks)?",
      "answer": "1) Avoid - eliminate the threat entirely. 2) Transfer - shift impact to third party. 3) Mitigate - reduce probability or impact. 4) Accept - acknowledge and deal with if it occurs. 5) Escalate - outside project authority.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Each strategy fits different situations. Avoid works for high-impact risks you can redesign around. Transfer works for insurable risks. Mitigate for risks you can reduce. Accept for low-priority risks.",

    },
    {
      "id": "risk_005",
      "question": "What are the five response strategies for OPPORTUNITIES (positive risks)?",
      "answer": "1) Exploit - ensure the opportunity happens. 2) Enhance - increase probability or impact. 3) Share - allocate to third party best able to capture it. 4) Accept - take advantage if it occurs. 5) Escalate - outside project authority.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Notice the parallel to threat responses: Exploit↔Avoid, Enhance↔Mitigate, Share↔Transfer, Accept↔Accept, Escalate↔Escalate. Same logic, opposite direction.",

    {
      "id": "risk_006",
      "question": "WHY do we calculate Risk Score (Probability × Impact)?",
      "answer": "To prioritize risks. A high-probability/low-impact risk might be less urgent than a low-probability/high-impact one. The score helps allocate limited risk response resources to what matters most.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "why",
      "why_it_matters": "You can't respond to every risk equally - resources are limited. Risk score creates a prioritized list. But beware: some low-probability risks (like safety) might need attention regardless of score.",

    },
    {
      "id": "risk_007",
      "question": "What is a Risk Trigger?",
      "answer": "An indicator or warning sign that a risk is about to occur or has occurred. Triggers activate contingency plans and alert the team that a risk event is imminent.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Without triggers, you're caught off-guard when risks materialize. Triggers give you early warning to activate responses. Example: If vendor misses two progress reports, that triggers escalation.",

    },
    {
      "id": "risk_008",
      "question": "What is the difference between a Risk and an Issue?",
      "answer": "Risk = uncertain future event (might happen). Issue = current problem that has materialized and needs resolution now. When a risk occurs, it becomes an issue.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Managing them requires different approaches. Risks need monitoring and contingency planning. Issues need immediate action and resolution. Confusing them leads to wrong responses.",

    },
    {
      "id": "risk_009",
      "question": "WHY is risk identification an ongoing activity throughout the project?",
      "answer": "Because new risks emerge as the project progresses and more information becomes available. Early risks may resolve while new ones appear. Static risk management misses evolving threats and opportunities.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "why",
      "why_it_matters": "A risk register created at project start becomes stale. Regular risk reviews (at milestones, phase gates, or iterations) keep the team aware of current uncertainties, not historical ones.",

    },
    {
      "id": "risk_010",
      "question": "What is a Contingency Reserve vs. Management Reserve?",
      "answer": "Contingency Reserve = budget/time for KNOWN risks (identified in risk register). Management Reserve = budget/time for UNKNOWN risks (unforeseen events). Contingency is in baseline; management reserve is not.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Contingency addresses 'known unknowns' - risks you identified but don't know if they'll occur. Management reserve addresses 'unknown unknowns' - things you couldn't anticipate at all.",

    },
    {
      "id": "risk_011",
      "question": "What is a Risk Register?",
      "answer": "A document containing all identified risks, their analysis, response strategies, and status. It's the central repository for risk information - living documentation updated throughout the project.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Without a register, risk management is ad-hoc and forgotten. The register provides visibility, enables tracking, and serves as institutional memory. If a risk isn't in the register, it's probably not being managed.",

    },
    {
      "id": "risk_012",
      "question": "What is Expected Monetary Value (EMV)?",
      "answer": "EMV = Probability × Impact (in currency). Used in quantitative risk analysis to calculate the weighted average outcome. Positive EMV for opportunities, negative for threats.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "EMV puts risks in financial terms. A 20% chance of $100,000 loss = -$20,000 EMV. Summing EMVs gives an expected impact that can inform contingency reserve sizing and go/no-go decisions.",

    },
    {
      "id": "risk_013",
      "question": "What is Sensitivity Analysis (Tornado Diagram)?",
      "answer": "A technique that determines which risks have the most potential impact on the project. Shown as a tornado diagram where longer bars represent risks with greater influence on project outcomes.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Not all risks matter equally. Sensitivity analysis identifies which uncertainties actually drive outcomes, so you focus effort on risks that make a difference rather than treating all risks the same.",

    },
    {
      "id": "risk_014",
      "question": "What is Monte Carlo Simulation?",
      "answer": "A quantitative technique that runs thousands of simulations using probability distributions for uncertain variables. Produces a range of possible outcomes with their probabilities, not just a single estimate.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Single-point estimates hide uncertainty. Monte Carlo shows 'there's 80% chance we'll finish by June, 50% chance by May.' This enables risk-aware planning and realistic stakeholder expectations.",

    {
      "id": "risk_015",
      "question": "What is the difference between Risk Appetite, Tolerance, and Threshold?",
      "answer": "Appetite = general willingness to take risk (strategic level). Tolerance = acceptable variation from objectives (range). Threshold = specific point where risk becomes unacceptable (trigger for escalation).",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "These define how much risk is acceptable. Organizations with low risk appetite take conservative approaches. Thresholds determine when to escalate. Understanding them aligns risk decisions with organizational values.",

      "id": "risk_016",
      "question": "What is a Secondary Risk?",
      "answer": "A new risk that arises as a direct result of implementing a risk response. The cure creates new potential problems that must also be managed.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Risk responses aren't free - they can introduce new risks. Outsourcing to reduce cost risk creates vendor management risks. Secondary risks must be identified and included in the risk register.",

    },
    {
      "id": "risk_017",
      "question": "What is Residual Risk?",
      "answer": "The risk that remains after responses have been implemented. Even after mitigation, some exposure typically remains. Residual risk should be documented and may require contingency plans.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Risk responses rarely eliminate risk entirely. Mitigation reduces but doesn't eliminate. Understanding residual risk ensures you're not surprised when partially-mitigated risks still affect the project.",

      "id": "risk_018",
      "question": "What is a Workaround?",
      "answer": "An unplanned response to a risk that has occurred but was not anticipated (no contingency plan exists). It's reactive problem-solving for risks that weren't identified or risks whose contingency plans failed.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Not all risks can be identified. When unplanned risks occur, workarounds are necessary. They're documented after the fact and lessons learned captured to improve future risk identification.",

    },
    {
      "id": "risk_019",
      "question": "WHY should risks be categorized (technical, external, organizational, PM)?",
      "answer": "Categories help ensure comprehensive identification (checklist by category), enable pattern recognition (are most risks technical?), and match risks to appropriate responders (technical risks to tech leads).",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "why",
      "why_it_matters": "Without categories, risk identification is haphazard and misses areas. A Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS) by category ensures systematic coverage. Patterns reveal systemic issues needing attention.",

      "answer": "A summary of overall project risk status, including key individual risks, overall risk exposure, trends, and risk response effectiveness. Used to communicate risk status to stakeholders.",
      "knowledge_area": "Risk",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "The risk register is detailed; the risk report is the executive summary. Stakeholders need visibility into risk status without wading through every entry. Reports enable informed governance decisions.",
