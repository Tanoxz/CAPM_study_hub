      "question": "What is the difference between Cost Baseline and Project Budget?",
      "answer": "Cost Baseline = time-phased budget for planned work (used for performance measurement). Project Budget = cost baseline PLUS management reserve. The baseline is what you're measured against; management reserve is extra for unknowns.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "If you include management reserve in your baseline, you'll show better variance than reality. The baseline should reflect planned work only. Management reserve is your 'insurance' for true surprises.",

      "question": "What is the difference between Contingency Reserve and Management Reserve?",
      "answer": "Contingency Reserve = for KNOWN risks (identified in risk register) - part of the cost baseline, used by PM. Management Reserve = for UNKNOWN risks (unforeseen events) - outside baseline, typically requires sponsor approval to use.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "This is 'known unknowns' vs 'unknown unknowns'. Contingency handles risks you identified. Management reserve handles surprises you couldn't predict. Using one for the other violates proper risk/budget management.",

      "question": "WHY does the Finance domain emphasize value maximization, not just cost control?",
      "answer": "Because the cheapest project isn't necessarily the best one. Finance connects to strategy - a project that costs more but delivers greater ROI, faster time-to-market, or higher quality may be the better investment.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "why",
      "why_it_matters": "Pure cost focus leads to penny-wise, pound-foolish decisions. Cutting corners that hurt quality or delay delivery destroys value. Finance management should optimize the RATIO of value delivered to resources consumed.",

      "answer": "CapEx (Capital Expenditures) = funds for acquiring/upgrading physical assets (property, equipment, technology). OpEx (Operating Expenditures) = ongoing costs of daily operations (salaries, rent, utilities). They're often budgeted and approved differently.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Many organizations treat CapEx and OpEx differently for accounting, tax, and approval purposes. A PM who tries to shift costs between categories without understanding this creates financial reporting problems.",

      "id": "fin_005",
      "question": "WHY is variance analysis (comparing actual to planned costs) so important?",
      "answer": "Because variance tells you if you're on track and enables corrective action. Early detection of overspending allows you to adjust before it's too late. Without variance analysis, you only learn you're over budget when the money runs out.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "why",
      "why_it_matters": "Variance isn't just 'we spent more than planned.' It's a diagnostic tool. Negative variance might mean scope creep, poor estimates, or inefficiency. Understanding WHY variance exists guides the right corrective action.",

      "id": "fin_006",
      "question": "What is Earned Value Management (EVM)?",
      "answer": "A methodology that integrates scope, schedule, and cost to objectively measure project performance. It compares planned value (what should have been done), earned value (what was actually done), and actual cost (what it cost).",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "EVM answers questions like: 'Are we getting value for our spending?' You can be under budget but behind schedule (inefficient). EVM reveals the true picture by combining cost AND progress in one framework.",

    },
    {
      "id": "fin_007",
      "question": "What are the common estimating techniques for costs?",
      "answer": "Analogous (top-down using similar past projects), Parametric (statistical models like $/sq ft), Bottom-up (detailed estimates rolled up), Three-point/PERT (optimistic, pessimistic, most likely), Expert Judgment.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Each technique fits different situations. Analogous is fast but rough. Bottom-up is accurate but time-consuming. Three-point handles uncertainty. Using the wrong technique for your situation produces unreliable estimates.",

    {
      "id": "fin_008",
      "question": "WHY might a project's financial management differ based on development approach?",
      "answer": "Adaptive projects have evolving scope, so traditional fixed budgets don't fit. Instead, they might budget per iteration or timeframe, adjusting funding based on actual progress and changing priorities each cycle.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "why",

      "answer": "ROI (Return on Investment), IRR (Internal Rate of Return), NPV (Net Present Value), Payback Period, ROA (Return on Assets), BCR (Benefit-Cost Ratio). Each measures value differently.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "definition",

    },
    {
      "id": "fin_010",
      "question": "WHY is understanding funding sources important for project managers?",
      "answer": "Because funding affects constraints - grants may have reporting requirements, customer contracts have payment schedules, internal budgets may expire at fiscal year-end. The source of money shapes how and when you can spend it.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "why",
      "why_it_matters": "A PM who doesn't understand funding constraints may plan to spend money that's not yet available, or lose budget because it wasn't spent before year-end. Funding timing affects cash flow and project execution.",

      "id": "fin_011",
      "question": "What is Cost Variance (CV)?",
      "answer": "CV = Earned Value (EV) - Actual Cost (AC). Measures cost performance in currency. Positive CV = under budget (spent less than the value earned). Negative CV = over budget.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "CV tells you whether you're getting value for your spending. Unlike simple 'actual vs. budget', CV relates spending to actual progress. Spending less means nothing if you're also delivering less.",

    },
    {
      "id": "fin_012",
      "question": "What is Cost Performance Index (CPI)?",
      "answer": "CPI = EV / AC. A ratio showing cost efficiency. CPI = 1.0 means on budget. CPI > 1.0 means under budget (getting more than $1 value per $1 spent). CPI < 1.0 means over budget.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "CPI is the most critical EVM metric because it's a strong predictor of final cost. Once established, CPI rarely improves - a project with 0.8 CPI will likely finish about 25% over budget.",

    },
    {
      "id": "fin_013",
      "question": "What is Estimate at Completion (EAC)?",
      "answer": "The expected total cost of the project when complete. Multiple formulas exist: EAC = BAC/CPI (if current efficiency continues), EAC = AC + (BAC-EV) (if original estimates hold), and others.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "EAC tells stakeholders 'what will this actually cost?' rather than 'what did we plan?' It enables early warning and corrective action. Different formulas apply to different assumptions about future performance.",

      "answer": "ETC = the expected cost to finish the remaining work. ETC = EAC - AC. It answers 'how much MORE will we need to spend?' rather than total cost.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "Stakeholders often ask 'how much more money do you need?' rather than total cost. ETC tells them what's still required. It's also useful for replanning remaining work.",

      "answer": "VAC = BAC - EAC. The expected budget surplus or shortfall at project completion. Positive VAC = project expected to finish under budget. Negative VAC = expected overrun.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "VAC gives stakeholders early visibility into whether they'll need more funding. A VAC of -$50,000 means 'start preparing for an extra $50K request' not 'surprise at the end'.",

      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "definition",
      "why_it_matters": "TCPI answers 'how efficient must we be going forward?' If TCPI > 1.0, you need to be MORE efficient than planned. If TCPI is much > 1.0 (like 1.3), meeting the budget may be unrealistic.",

    },
    {
      "id": "fin_017",
      "question": "WHY is the Time Value of Money important in project selection?",
      "answer": "Because a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future (due to inflation and opportunity cost). NPV and IRR account for this when comparing projects with different timing of costs and benefits.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "why",
      "why_it_matters": "A project returning $1M in year 1 is better than one returning $1M in year 5 (same nominal amount, different real value). Financial metrics that ignore timing can select inferior projects.",

      "answer": "Direct Costs = clearly attributable to the project (team salaries, materials). Indirect Costs = shared across projects or organization (rent, utilities, administrative overhead). Indirect costs are often allocated via a rate.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "definition",

      "answer": "Considering the TOTAL cost of ownership over the life of the product/asset - not just project/development costs, but operations, maintenance, support, and disposal costs too.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "definition",

    {
      "id": "fin_020",
      "question": "WHY should project funding be linked to stage gates or decision points?",
      "answer": "Because it prevents sunk cost fallacy and enables course correction. Releasing funds incrementally based on demonstrated progress protects the organization from continuing to invest in failing projects.",
      "knowledge_area": "Finance",
      "card_type": "why",
