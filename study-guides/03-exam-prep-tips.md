## Study Strategies

### 1. Take Breaks
Don't cram for hours. Use the Pomodoro Technique:
- Study for 30 minutes
- Take a 10-minute walk
- Think about what you just learned
- Let it sink in before piling more on top

> Students who take breaks remember **20% more** than those who don't.

### 2. Review Agile Considerations
The exam covers agile alongside predictive methodologies.
- Read the agile considerations in each PMBOK chapter
- Understand the PMI talent triangle
- Know how agile differs from predictive/waterfall

### 3. Focus on YOUR Challenging Topics
After initial review, identify what YOU personally find difficult:
- Cost, Communications, and Procurement often cited as detailed/complicated
- Integration, Communication, and Stakeholder management for others
- Your challenges will differ based on your experience

### 4. Make Flashcards
Physical or digital cards for terms and definitions:
- Use a flashcard app on your phone
- Study during "spare time" (waiting for appointments, etc.)
- Drill several times daily until you can go through without mistakes

### 5. Use an Exam Simulator
Practice with realistic questions:
- Don't get discouraged by low practice scores (passing at 62% in practice is common)
- Read explanations for ALL answers (correct and incorrect)
- Spend equal time reviewing results as answering

### 6. Get a Physical PMBOK Guide
While PMI members get free PDF:
- Physical copy allows highlighting/notes/tabs
- Much faster than transcribing notes separately
- Worth the investment

### 7. Plan Your Study Time
Create a structured schedule:
- Plan chapters/subjects per week
- Build in daily flexibility
- Minimum 2 hours/day recommended for intensive prep
- Spread out if needed - any schedule works if planned

### 8. Learn Core Processes
Focus on understanding WHAT and WHY:
- Most questions test knowledge of terms and concepts
- Some situational questions require applying knowledge
- If you know the material, correct answers are usually obvious

### 9. Understand the Formulas
Not much math, but know:
- EVA (Earned Value Analysis) formulas
- Critical path calculation
- Built-in calculator available in exam
- Understand the formulas, don't just memorize

### 11. Learn to Flag Questions
Use the "mark for review" feature:
- Answer questions you know immediately
- Flag uncertain ones for later review

### 12. Plan Your Exam Time
3 hours = ~1.2 minutes per question

Sample pacing strategy:
1. 50 questions
2. 3-minute break
3. 50 questions
4. 5-minute break
5. 50 questions
6. Bathroom/stretch break
7. Review flagged questions

> Most students finish with 45-70 minutes remaining.

### 13. Know What to Expect
