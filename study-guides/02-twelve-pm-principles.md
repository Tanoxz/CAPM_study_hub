# The 12 Project Management Principles

The PMBOK Guide (7th Edition+) shifted from process-driven to principle-driven project management. These 12 principles guide project execution regardless of methodology (agile, predictive, hybrid).

---

## 1. Stewardship
**"Be a diligent, respectful, and caring steward"**

Taking care of your project and acting with its best interests in mind at all times.

### Core Values
- **Integrity** - decisions above reproach
- **Honesty** - stakeholders can trust you
- **Fairness** - equitable treatment
- **Responsibility** - ethical practices as the norm

### In Practice
- Standing up for what's right, even when difficult
- Following the PMI Code of Ethics
- Paying attention to details and following through on requests
- Careful thinking and negotiating conflicting requirements

---

## 2. Team
**"Build a culture of accountability and respect"**

Projects are delivered through teams. Create an environment where every team member holds every other team member accountable.

### Key Concepts
- Team accountability is NOT one person holding everyone accountable
- It's a culture where everyone holds everyone accountable
- Lack of accountability leads to misalignment and inefficiency

### In Practice
- Hold yourself accountable first (lead by example)
- Give and receive constructive criticism
- Ensure all voices are heard
- Embrace conflict as a positive force for better results
- Provide regular constructive feedback

---

## 3. Stakeholders
**"Engage stakeholders to understand their interests and needs"**

A stakeholder is someone interested in or impacted by the project. Understanding their motivations makes successful delivery easier.

### Key Concepts
- Know what you're engaging them in (process, deliverables, or both)
- Tailor communication to share messages appropriately
- Stakeholder community may change throughout the project

### In Practice
- Initiate dialogue early during planning
- Facilitate workshops ensuring all voices are heard
- Resolve conflicts between stakeholders with different views
- Work with teams to reduce resistance to change

---

## 4. Value
**"Focus on value"**

Value = balance between benefits gained and resources spent. Perception of value differs between stakeholders.

### Framework
> "We are moving from X to Y by [date] with a projected benefit of [financial value/other benefit]."

### In Practice
- Regular meetings with stakeholders to ensure the project meets their needs
- Backlog grooming to prioritize highest-value items first
- Regularly reviewing the business case
- Collaborating with team members on status and estimates

---

## 5. Holistic Thinking
**"Recognize and respond to systems interactions"**

Systems thinking = viewing the entire system, individual parts, behavior, and relationships over time.

### Techniques for Complex Problems
- **Rich Pictures** - visual representation of problems
- **Causal Loop Diagrams** - cause and effect relationships
- **CATWOE** - Customers, Actors, Transformation, Worldview, Owner, Environment
- **System Mapping** - understanding interconnections
- **Action Learning** - learning through doing

### In Practice
- Accurately mapping business processes
- Understanding IT system interactions
- Mapping data flows through the whole system
- Accounting for multiple perspectives on delivery

---

## 6. Leadership
**"Motivate, influence, coach, and learn"**

Project managers typically don't have line management authority - leadership means getting things done without formal authority.

### Key Concepts
- Facilitative/servant leadership style works best
- More about influencing and inspiring than commanding
- Model how the team can step up

### In Practice
- Help team members understand vision, goals, and their role
- Lead by example - be the culture you want to see
- Mentor colleagues
- Enable team success through support

---

## 7. Tailoring
**"Tailor the delivery approach based on context"**

Choosing the right approach based on organizational context, team culture and maturity, and what you're delivering.

### Key Concepts
- Not all projects need every process, deliverable, and governance item
- What works for one project may not work for another
- Build tailoring competence over time

### In Practice
- Review change management process for fitness
- Ensure everyone understands the approach being used
- Hold regular discussions about how work is going
- Document lessons learned for future reference

---

## 8. Quality
**"Build quality into processes and results"**

Quality means the end product meets customer needs - not more, not less. Without quality, no value is created.

### Key Concepts
- Define quality standards in Initiation or Planning
- Measure in-process quality to correct course early
- Quality is becoming more multifaceted (includes HOW we achieve outcomes)

### In Practice
- Robust quality management approaches
- Conversations about what quality work is and how it's measured
- Ensure teams have sufficient tools and resources
- Plan time for quality activities - don't skip them

---

## 9. Complexity
**"Address complexity using knowledge, experience, and learning"**

Complexity = the state of being intricate or complicated. Many factors influence project complexity.

### Complexity Factors
- Uncertainty about scope
- Newer technologies
- Multiple stakeholders
- Multiple partners
- System interdependencies
- New territory/markets

### In Practice
- Invite the right people with good expertise
- Create a culture of continuous learning
- Look for and expect complexity, then plan to address it
- Break massive projects into manageable micro-projects
- Regular team huddles and collaboration tools

---

## 10. Risk
**"Optimize risk responses"**

Risk = "uncertainty that matters" (Dr. David Hillson). Active risk management brings more certainty to work.

### Probability/Impact Assessment
1. Rate probability (1-5 scale)
2. Rate impact (1-5 scale)
3. Calculate risk score (probability x impact)
4. Sort risks by score (descending)
5. Use risk threshold to determine which need response plans

### In Practice
- Conduct risk analyses and make decisions based on risk profile
- Help team and executives understand risks
- Make smart choices about risk responses
- Address both positive (opportunities) and negative risks

**Exam Tip:** Risk questions appear frequently on the CAPM exam.

---

## 11. Adaptability & Resilience
**"Be adaptable and resilient"**

Ability to switch paths, deliver faster, and bounce back after setbacks.

### Key Concepts
- Resilience of individual, team, AND organization
- Developed collaboratively, not in isolation
- Foster innovation through engagement and sharing

### In Practice
- Create learning plans for the team
- Listen to stakeholders and be prepared to change approach
- Lead by example (take breaks, finish on time)
- Reiterate project value to remind team of purpose
- Be open to change

---

## 12. Change Management
**"Enable change to achieve the envisioned future state"**

Project management IS about delivering change. People are at the heart of it.

### Key Questions (Answer Early)
1. What is the change?
2. Why is it required?
3. How will it impact those affected?
4. What happens if the change doesn't go ahead?
5. How will people be supported through and after?

### Support Mechanisms
- Communications
- Training
- User guides
- Change champions

### In Practice
- During organizational transitions
- Helping teams understand new processes/software
- When changes affect external parties
- Helping team members voice concerns
