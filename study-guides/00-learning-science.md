# Learning Science: Evidence-Based Study Design

How this app is designed, and why.

---

## The Core Problem

Traditional studying (re-reading, highlighting, cramming) creates **illusion of mastery** - it feels like learning but fades quickly. Research shows these methods are largely ineffective for long-term retention and real understanding.

## Six Evidence-Based Learning Strategies

Based on *Make It Stick* (Brown, Roediger, McDaniel) and cognitive psychology research:

### 1. Retrieval Practice (Active Recall)
**What:** Actively pulling information from memory, not passively reviewing it.

**Why it works:** The act of retrieving strengthens memory pathways. Testing yourself is a learning event, not just an assessment.

**In this app:** Quizzes and flashcards that require you to recall answers before seeing them.

> "Practice retrieving what you have learnt" - this dramatically outperforms re-reading.

---

### 2. Spaced Repetition
**What:** Spreading study sessions over time with increasing intervals.

**Why it works:** Each retrieval when you're about to forget strengthens the memory. Cramming bypasses long-term memory formation.

**In this app:** Flashcards scheduled based on how well you remember them - harder cards appear more often, mastered cards less frequently.

> Studying for 8 hours over 2 weeks beats studying for 8 hours in one sitting.

---

### 3. Interleaving
**What:** Mixing different topics/problem types instead of blocking (studying one topic exhaustively before moving to the next).

**Why it works:** Forces your brain to discriminate between concepts and select appropriate strategies. Builds mental models that transfer to new situations.

**In this app:** Quizzes mix questions from different Knowledge Areas. Study sessions rotate topics.

> Feels harder but produces better long-term learning and application.

---

### 4. Elaborative Interrogation
**What:** Asking "Why?" and "How?" questions about facts - generating explanations.

**Why it works:** Connects new information to existing knowledge. Activates schemas (mental networks) that organize information for better retrieval.

**In this app:** Questions that ask "Why does this work?" not just "What is this called?" Explanations that connect concepts to real-world scenarios.

> Students using elaborative interrogation remember 27% more than those who just read facts.

**Limitation:** Works best when you have some prior knowledge to connect to. Less effective for complete beginners on very abstract topics.

---

### 5. Generation (Productive Struggle)
**What:** Attempting to solve a problem or answer a question BEFORE seeing the answer.

**Why it works:** The struggle to generate an answer, even if wrong, primes your brain to encode the correct answer more deeply.

**In this app:** Show the question, let you think/attempt an answer, THEN reveal the solution with explanation.

---

### 6. Reflection
**What:** Thinking about what you learned, asking yourself questions, connecting to experience.

**Why it works:** Consolidates learning and identifies gaps.

**In this app:** End-of-session summaries. "What did you struggle with?" prompts.

## Bloom's Taxonomy: Levels of Thinking

The CAPM exam tests different cognitive levels. Your studying should match.

| Level | What It Means | Example Question |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **Remember** | Recall facts | "What are the 5 process groups?" |
| **Understand** | Explain concepts | "Describe the purpose of the planning process group" |
| **Apply** | Use in new situations | "Given this scenario, which process would you use?" |
| **Analyze** | Break down, identify patterns | "What's the root cause of this project issue?" |
| **Evaluate** | Judge, assess | "Which response is BEST for this situation?" |
| **Create** | Synthesize, design | (Less common on CAPM) |

**CAPM focuses heavily on Remember, Understand, and Apply levels** - but scenario-based questions require you to apply knowledge, not just recall it.

## Conceptual vs. Rote Learning: The Balance

### What Needs Conceptual Understanding
- WHY processes exist (what problem they solve)
- HOW knowledge areas relate to each other
- WHEN to use different approaches
- Scenario-based questions ("what would you do?")

### What Needs Some Memorization
- Specific terminology (must know the PMI vocabulary)
- Key formulas (EVA, critical path)
- Process inputs/outputs (know what goes in and out)
- The 12 principles (know what they are)

### The Sweet Spot
> "Conceptual learners perform better in exams because they can handle new or twisted questions. They don't depend on recalling the exact wording; they rely on their understanding."

**Approach:** Learn the concept FIRST, then anchor specific terms/facts to that understanding.

---

## What DOESN'T Work (Avoid These)

| Ineffective Method | Why It Fails |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Re-reading notes | Creates familiarity, not mastery |
| Highlighting | Passive; doesn't engage retrieval |
| Cramming | Bypasses long-term memory |
| Massed practice (same topic repeatedly) | Feels productive but doesn't build discrimination |
| Reading without testing yourself | No retrieval = weak encoding |

---

## Desirable Difficulties

Strategies that feel harder in the short term but produce better long-term results:

- Spacing (feels like you're forgetting)
- Interleaving (feels confusing)
- Generation (feels frustrating)
- Testing yourself (feels uncomfortable)

**Embrace the struggle** - if studying feels too easy, you're probably not learning effectively.

## How This Shapes the App Design

### Flashcards
- Show question first, require mental retrieval before revealing answer
- Spaced repetition scheduling (SM-2 algorithm or similar)
- Include "Why?" cards, not just definitions
- Mix Knowledge Areas in review sessions

### Quizzes
- Scenario-based questions that test application
- Immediate feedback with explanations (not just "correct/incorrect")
- Interleaved topics
- Track performance by concept, not just overall score

### Study Guides
- Organized by Knowledge Area (chunked learning)
- Emphasize WHY and WHEN, not just WHAT
- Connect concepts to each other
- Real-world examples and analogies

### Progress Tracking
- Confidence ratings by concept
- Identify weak areas for focused practice
- Spaced review reminders
