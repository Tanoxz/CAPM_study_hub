Introduction
This section describes important information about A Guide to the Project 
Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Seventh Edition. It 
describes the relationship of the PMBOK® Guide to The Standard for Project 
Management [1],1 changes to the PMBOK® Guide, the relationship to 
PMIstandards™ (PMI’s digital platform for standards), and provides a brief 
overview of the content.
1.1 Structure of the PMBOK® Guide
In addition to this Introduction, this edition of the PMBOK® Guide contains three sections:
▶ 	 Section 2 Project Performance Domains. This section identifies and describes eight project 
performance domains that form an integrated system to enable successful delivery of the project 
and intended outcomes.
▶ 	 Section 3 Tailoring. This section describes what tailoring is and presents an overview  
of what to tailor and how to go about tailoring individual projects.
▶ 	 Section 4 Models, Methods, and Artifacts. This section presents a brief description of commonly 
used models, methods, and artifacts. These models, methods, and artifacts illustrate the range of 
options project teams can use to produce deliverables, organize work, and enable communication 
and collaboration.

Tools and Techniques 
All of the tools and techniques in this section appear in alphabetical order; therefore, no section 
numbers are assigned. 
Active listening. Active listening involves techniques such as acknowledging, clarifying, confirming, 
understanding, and addressing barriers that hinder effective communication and comprehension. 
Active listening is used to reduce misunderstandings and other miscommunications with stakeholders. 
It is particularly critical when working in global or cross-cultural environments, where team members 
may interpret messages differently due to diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds. 
Affinity diagram. An affinity diagram shows large numbers of ideas classified into groups for review 
and analysis. Affinity diagrams can also organize potential causes of defects into groups showing the 
areas that should be focused on the most. 
After-action reviews (AARs). After-action reviews are a simple, structured process used to analyze 
what happened, why it happened, and how it can be done better by the participants and those 
responsible for the project or activity. Originating from the U.S. Army, AARs are designed to improve 
team performance by reflecting on actions taken and outcomes achieved. The AARs are typically 
conducted at the end of a project or after significant milestones to capture lessons learned and 
inform future activities. The AARs may include the following: 
• 
Diagnostic process. The diagnostic process involves diagnosing what went well and what 
did not, and identifying both strengths and weaknesses. 
• 
Documentation. Findings from the AARs are documented and shared with relevant 
stakeholders to help ensure that valuable lessons are captured and disseminated.

• 
Learning and improvement. The primary goal is to reinforce learning and improve future 
performance by applying the insights gained from the review. 
• 
Participant involvement. All team members involved in the project participate in the 
review, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the events and outcomes. 
• 
Structured reflection. The AARs follow a structured format, asking four key questions: 
◾ 
What was supposed to happen? 
◾ 
What actually happened? 
◾ 
Why were there differences? 
◾ 
What can we learn? 
In summary, AARs are a valuable tool for continuous improvement in project management. The 
reviews provide a structured approach to reflect on project performance, engage team members in 
the diagnostic process, and capture lessons learned to enhance future projects. 
Agile release planning. Agile release planning provides a high-level summary timeline of the release 
schedule (typically 3–6 months) based on the product roadmap and the product vision for the product’s 
evolution. Agile release planning determines the number of iterations or sprints in the release. This 
planning empowers the product owner and team to determine the development scope, timelines, and 
a releasable product, factoring in business goals, dependencies, impediments, and resource availability. 
Since features represent expected value to the customer, the timeline provides a more easily 
understood project schedule as it defines which features will be available at the end of each iteration. 
Figure 5-1 shows the typical relationship among product vision, product roadmap, release planning, 
and iteration planning. While the figure shows tasks estimated in hours, it is important to note that 
many agile teams use story points instead. Story points reflect the relative effort or complexity rather 
than absolute time, based on the understanding that teams are typically better at comparing work 
items than predicting precise durations. This approach simplifies planning while preserving accuracy, 
as estimating hours can be more time-consuming and less reliable in dynamic environments. 
Alternative analysis. Alternative analysis is a method used to evaluate identified options in order 
to select the options or approaches to use when performing the work of the project. In a project 
context, two examples include (1) determining what solution might best address a project’s business 
or mission objectives, and (2) determining the best approach for executing and completing project 
tasks within the defined constraints. 
Analogous estimating. Analogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration, cost, or 
required resources for an activity or a project using historical data from a similar activity or project. 
Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such as duration, budget, size, 
weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future project. 
When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects 
as the basis for estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, 
sometimes adjusted for known differences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating is 
frequently used to estimate project duration when there is limited detailed information about the project. 
Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less time-consuming than other techniques but can 
also be less accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments 
of a project and may be used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is

project team members preparing the estimates have the needed expertise. 
Artificial intelligence (AI). AI is the programming of machines with patterns and processes similar to 
those observed in—and by—humans and human interactions. 
•
Machine learning (ML). Machine learning is a part of AI, and its main goal is to develop
software that can learn from past experiences, similar to what humans do. Common fields
include recognizing speech and images; predicting weather, stock market behavior, and
traffic; operating autonomous cars; filtering email spam; and providing a medical diagnosis.
• 
Natural language processing (NLP). The NLP technique’s goal is to build software that
can process natural language, like humans. In other words, people communicate with
computers in their own natural language. Some NLP examples include chatbots, speech
recognition, text extraction and summarization, and sentiment analysis.
Assumption and constraint analysis. Every project is conceived and developed based on a set 
of assumptions and within a series of constraints. These assumptions and constraints are often 
already incorporated in the scope baseline and project estimates. Assumption and constraint 
analysis explores the validity of assumptions and constraints to determine which pose a risk to the 
project. Threats may be identified from the inaccuracy, instability, inconsistency, or incompleteness

of assumptions. Constraints may give rise to opportunities through removing or relaxing a limiting 
factor that affects the execution of a project or process. 
Audits. An audit is a structured, independent process used to determine if project activities comply 
with organizational and project policies, processes, and procedures. 
• 
Procurement audit. A procurement audit is a structured review of the procurement 
process, which includes the review of contracts and contracting processes for 
completeness, accuracy, and effectiveness. Rights and obligations related to audits should 
be described in the procurement contract. Resulting audit observations should be brought 
to the attention of the buyer’s project manager and the seller’s project manager for 
adjustments to the project, when necessary. 
• 
Quality audit. A quality audit is usually conducted by a team external to the project, such 
as the organization’s internal audit department, project management office (PMO), or 
an auditor external to the organization. Quality audit objectives may include but are not 
limited to the following: 
◾ 
Identifying all good practices being implemented; 
◾ 
Identifying all nonconformities, gaps, and shortcomings; 
◾ 
Sharing good practices introduced or implemented in similar projects in the 
organization and/or industry; 
◾ 
Proactively offering assistance in a positive manner to improve the implementation of 
processes to help raise team productivity; 
◾ 
Highlighting contributions of each audit in the lessons learned repository of the 
organization; 
◾ 
Subsequent efforts to correct any deficiencies should result in a reduced cost of quality 
and an increase in sponsor or customer acceptance of the project’s product; 
◾ 
Quality audits may be scheduled or random, and may be conducted by internal or 
external auditors; and 
◾ 
Quality audits can confirm the implementation of approved change requests including 
updates, corrective actions, defect repairs, and preventive actions. 
• 
Risk audit. A risk audit is a type of audit that may be used to consider the effectiveness of the 
risk management process. The project manager is responsible for ensuring that risk audits 
are performed at an appropriate frequency, as defined in the project’s risk management plan. 
Risk audits may be included during routine project review meetings, may form part of a risk 
review meeting, or the team may choose to hold separate risk audit meetings. The format for 
the risk audit and its objectives should be clearly defined before the audit is conducted. 
Augmented reality (AR). Augmented reality is the use of technology to simulate and enhance the 
actual, physical reality and environment through the overlay of digital information. This technique 
connects the real and digital worlds through technologies and devices such as smartphones or headsets. 
Autocratic decision-making. See decision-making. 
Backlog management. Backlog management is primarily used in adaptive approaches to maintain 
the list of backlog items to be worked on during a project and refers to the process by which the 
owner of the backlog, commonly a product owner, assists in keeping the backlog up to date. To avoid

confusion, it is important to distinguish between the product backlog, which contains the complete 
list of desired features and changes for the product, and the sprint backlog, which includes only the 
subset of items selected for delivery in a specific iteration. 
In adaptive approaches, backlog management is the technique used to manage changes. The list 
of backlog items is ranked in order of business value or importance to the customer and sized 
by the development team so that the highest value items are selected and delivered in the next 
development cycle. Dependencies and constraints are also taken into account, which could impact 
the order of the new item and changes in the backlog. 
Backlog refinement. Backlog refinement is the progressive elaboration of the content in the backlog 
and reprioritization of it to identify the work that can be accomplished in an upcoming iteration. This 
technique is used mostly within adaptive development approaches. Backlog refinement involves 
constantly reviewing, revising, ranking, and editing the product backlog in order to build features that 
are needed by the business and the customer. During a backlog refinement meeting, the backlog is 
elaborated and reprioritized to identify the work that can be accomplished during the upcoming iteration. 
Benchmarking. Benchmarking is the comparison of actual or planned products, processes, and 
practices to those of comparable organizations to identify good practices, generate ideas for 
improvement, and provide a basis for measuring performance. Benchmarked projects may exist 
within the performing organization or outside of it, or can be within the same application area 
or other application area. Benchmarking allows analogies to be made for projects in different 
application areas or industries. 
Bottom-up estimating. Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating the duration, cost, 
or required resources by aggregating the estimates of the lower-level components of the work 
breakdown structure (WBS). When an activity’s duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable 
degree of confidence, the work within the activity is decomposed into more detail. The detailed 
durations are estimated. These estimates are then aggregated into a total quantity for each of the 
activity’s durations. Activities may or may not have dependencies between them that can affect 
the application and use of resources. If there are dependencies, this pattern of resource usage is 
reflected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity. 
Brainstorming. The brainstorming technique is used to identify a list of ideas in a short period of 
time. Brainstorming is conducted in a group environment and is led by a facilitator. The technique 
comprises two parts: idea generation and analysis. Brainstorming can be used to gather data and 
solutions or ideas from stakeholders, subject matter experts, and team members. 
Brainstorming techniques. There are many brainstorming techniques, including the following: 
• 
Brain-netting, or virtual brainstorming, uses a digital collaboration platform, documents 
stored on a cloud or server, or other online tools in order to generate and prioritize ideas, 
discussing the advantages and disadvantages of specific topics. Anonymous idea sharing 
can be included as well. 
• 
Brainwriting encourages everyone in the brainstorming session to participate and write 
their ideas down before sharing them with other team members. Later, the facilitator 
collects the ideas and shares them or asks others to share and discuss them with the group. 
• 
Idea napkin involves documenting ideas in five steps on a napkin. The five steps include 
such topics as people, offering, customer, value proposition, and core competencies.

• 
Individual brainstorming encourages creative thinking and includes techniques such as: 
◾ 
Free writing. A time-based writing session when people generate ideas and write until 
an alarm sounds, ignoring grammar and spelling; 
◾ 
Word association. Creating a list of words and relating them to a topic, which 
stimulates the development of numerous creative and unconventional ideas; and 
◾ 
Spiderwebs. Visual note-taking that diagrams the process of thought, where one idea 
can stimulate other related ideas. 
• 
Mind mapping. See mind mapping. 
• 
Reverse brainstorming is a brainstorming technique used by teams to create ideas about 
how to make a problem worse instead of solving it, which may help to identify the root 
cause of a problem. 
• 
Round-robin is a brainstorming technique where everyone within the team takes a turn to 
generate and develop ideas. 
• 
Starbursting is a brainstorming technique with a main goal of creating a list of questions 
related to an idea or an issue from different angles. The star has six points, each 
representing a different question: who, what, when, where, why, and how. 
• 
SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. See SWOT analysis. 
• 
Five whys analysis is an iterative brainstorming technique that repeatedly asks “why” in 
order to get beyond symptoms and get to the root cause of the problem. 
Branch and bound. The branch and bound technique is a minimal path to the optimal solution 
for a given problem. Branch and bound is an optimization problem-solving method that involves 
breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems and using bounding functions to eliminate any 
subproblems that do not contain the optimal solution. This technique could be used for project 
scheduling by systematically exploring and pruning potential schedules to find an optimal sequence 
of tasks that minimizes project completion time while satisfying all constraints. 
Burndown chart. A burndown chart is a graphical representation of the work remaining versus the 
time left in a timebox. See also iteration burndown chart. 
Burnup chart. A burnup chart is a graphical representation of the work completed toward a milestone. 
Burnup charts are used mostly within adaptive development approaches to show project progress over 
time. The chart tracks the amount of work to be completed as a straight line across the top of the graph. 
The work completed starts at zero and increases as more work is completed. See also visual controls. 
Cause-and-effect diagram. A cause-and effect diagram is a visual representation that helps trace 
an effect back to its root cause. A cause-and-effect diagram may also be known as a fishbone or 
Ishikawa diagram. This type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement identified 
into discrete branches, helping to identify the main or root cause of the problem. 
Centralized management and leadership. While leadership activities should be practiced by 
all project team members, management activities may be centralized or distributed. Centralized 
management and leadership is a management structure that consists of top-down leadership 
and instructions for decision implementation for other levels of management. As opposed to 
implementing distributed management and leadership, a centralized management and leadership 
structure means that the decision-making and authority are centralized within top management

and are conducted by a small number of senior leaders. In an environment where management 
activities are centralized, accountability (being answerable for an outcome) is usually assigned to 
one individual such as the project manager or similar role. In these situations, a project charter or 
other authorizing document can provide approval for the project manager to form a project team to 
achieve the project outcomes. See also distributed management and leadership. 
Change control tools. To facilitate configuration and change management, both manual and 
automated tools can be utilized. Configuration control focuses on specifying both deliverables and 
processes, while change control is concerned with identifying, documenting, and approving or 
rejecting changes to project documents, deliverables, or baselines. Tool selection should be based on 
the needs of project stakeholders, considering organizational and environmental constraints. 
Configuration management activities supported by these change control tools include identifying 
configuration items, recording and reporting their status, and performing configuration item 
verification and audits. These activities can ensure that the product configuration is defined 
and verified, changes are managed, and accountability is maintained, meeting the functional 
requirements outlined in the configuration documentation. 
Change management activities supported by these change control tools include identifying and 
selecting change items, documenting changes into proper change requests, and deciding on changes by 
reviewing, approving, rejecting, or deferring them. Additionally, tools help track changes by verifying that 
they are registered, assessed, approved, and communicated to stakeholders. Tools also manage change 
requests and the resulting decisions, with additional considerations for communication to assist the 
change control board (CCB) in their duties and to distribute decisions to the appropriate stakeholders. 
Checklists. A checklist is a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. Checklists are often used 
as reminders and are developed based on historical information and knowledge accumulated from 
similar projects and other sources of information. Using checklists is an effective way to capture 
lessons learned from similar completed projects, listing specific individual project risks that have 
occurred previously and that may be relevant to the current project. 
The organization may maintain checklists based on completed projects or use generic checklists from 
the industry. While a checklist may be quick and simple to use, it is impossible to build an exhaustive 
one. The project team should also explore items that do not appear on the checklist. Additionally, 
the checklist should be reviewed from time to time to update new information as well as remove or 
archive obsolete information. Checklists can also serve as an effective way to ensure that a project 
or task is ready to start; such a checklist is also called “definition of ready” or “full kit,” and can be 
particularly useful in minimizing rework. 
Coaching and mentoring. Coaching provides guidance and helps people (e.g., a project team 
member or a stakeholder) to find a solution to a specific problem on their own by asking the right 
questions. Mentoring is serving as a counselor, guide, or mentor by sharing knowledge, skills, or 
experience with a person who has to develop their own knowledge or skills. Both coaching and 
mentoring include one-to-one conversations. However, coaching is more related to achieving specific 
goals, while mentoring is a more long-term, ongoing relationship-building practice. 
Colocation. Colocation is an organizational placement strategy where the project team members are 
physically located close to one another in order to improve communication, working relationships, 
and productivity.

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
 
Colocation involves placing many or all of the most active project team members in the same physical 
location to enhance their ability to perform as a team. Colocation can be temporary, such as at 
strategically important times during the project, or can continue for the entire project. Colocation 
strategies may include a team meeting room, common places to post schedules, and other 
conveniences that enhance communication and a sense of community. 
Communication competence. Communication competence is a combination of tailored 
communication skills that considers factors such as clarity of purpose in key messages, effective 
relationships and information sharing, and leadership behaviors. 
Communication methods. A communication method is a systematic procedure, technique, or 
process used to transfer information among project stakeholders. 
There are several communication methods that are used to share information among project 
stakeholders. These methods are broadly classified as follows: 
• 
Interactive communication. Interactive communication occurs between two or more 
parties performing a multidirectional exchange of information in real time. Interactive 
communication employs communications artifacts such as meetings, phone calls, instant 
messaging, some forms of social media, and videoconferencing. 
• 
Push communication. Push communications are sent or distributed directly to specific 
recipients who need to receive the information. This method ensures that the information 
is distributed but does not ensure that it reaches or is understood by the intended 
audience. Push communication artifacts include letters, memos, reports, emails, faxes, 
voicemails, blogs, and press releases. 
• 
Pull communication. Pull communications are used for large, complex information sets 
or for large audiences, and require the recipients to access content at their own discretion 
subject to security procedures. These methods include web portals, intranet sites, 
eLearning courses, lessons learned databases, or knowledge repositories. 
Different approaches should be applied to meet the needs of the major forms of communication 
defined in the communications management plan: 
• 
Interpersonal communication. Interpersonal communication is information that is 
exchanged between individuals, typically face-to-face. 
• 
Small group communication. Small group communications occur within groups of three 
to six people. 
• 
Public communication. Public communication occurs when a single speaker, or group of 
speakers, addresses a larger audience. 
• 
Mass communication. Mass communication is an approach with minimal connection 
between the person or group sending the message and the large, sometimes anonymous, 
groups for whom the information is intended. 
• 
Networks and social computing communication. This type of communication approach 
supports emerging communication trends of many-to-many, which is often supported by 
social computing technology and the media.

Possible communication artifacts and methods include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
Notice boards; 
• 
Newsletters, in-house magazines, and e-magazines; 
• 
Letters to staff or volunteers; 
• 
Press releases; 
• 
Annual reports; 
• 
Emails and intranets; 
• 
Web portals and other information repositories (for pull communication); 
• 
Phone conversations; 
• 
Presentations; 
• 
Team briefings or group meetings; 
• 
Focus groups; 
• 
Face-to-face formal or informal meetings among various stakeholders; 
• 
Consultation groups or staff forums; and 
• 
Social computing technology and media. 
Communication models. A communication model is a description, analogy, or schematic used to 
represent how the communication process will be performed for the project. 
Communication models can represent the communication process in its most basic linear form (sender 
and receiver), in a more interactive form that encompasses the additional element of feedback (sender, 
receiver, and feedback), or in a more complex model that incorporates the human elements of the 
sender(s) or receiver(s) and attempts to show the complexity of any communication that involves people. 
• 
Sample basic sender/receiver communication model. This model describes 
communication as a process and consists of two parties, defined as the sender and 
receiver. This model is concerned with ensuring that the message is delivered rather than 
understood. The sequence of steps in a basic communication model is as follows: 
◾ 
Encode. The message is coded into symbols, such as text, sound, or some other 
medium, for transmission (sending). 
◾ 
Transmit message. The message is sent via a communication channel. The transmission 
of this message may be compromised by various physical factors such as unfamiliar 
technology or inadequate infrastructure. Noise and other factors may be present and 
contribute to loss of information in transmission and/or reception of the message. 
◾ 
Decode. The data received is translated by the receiver back into a form useful to 
the receiver. 
• 
Sample interactive communication model. This model also describes communication as a 
process consisting of two parties, the sender and receiver, but recognizes the need to ensure 
that the message has been understood. In this model, noise includes any interference or 
barriers that might compromise the understanding of the message, such as the distraction

of the receiver, variations in the perceptions of receivers, or lack of appropriate knowledge 
or interest. The additional steps in an interactive communication model are: 
◾ 
Acknowledge. Upon receipt of a message, the receiver may signal (acknowledge)
receipt of the message, but this does not necessarily mean agreement with or
comprehension of the message—merely that it has been received.
◾ 
Feedback/response. When the received message has been decoded and understood,
the receiver encodes thoughts and ideas into a message and then transmits this
message to the original sender. If the sender perceives that the feedback matches the
original message, the communication has been successful. In communication among
people, feedback can be achieved through active listening.
As part of the communication process, the sender is responsible for the transmission of the message, 
ensuring the information being communicated is clear and complete, and confirming the message is 
correctly interpreted. The receiver is responsible for ensuring that the information is received in its 
entirety, interpreted correctly, and acknowledged or responded to appropriately. These components take 
place in an environment where there will likely be noise and other barriers to effective communication. 
Cross-cultural communication presents challenges to ensuring that the meaning of the message 
has been understood. Differences in communication styles can arise from differences in working 
methods, age, nationality, professional discipline, ethnicity, race, or gender. People from different 
cultures communicate using different languages (e.g., technical design documents or different styles) 
and expect different processes and protocols. 
The communication model shown in Figure 5-2 incorporates the idea that the message itself, and 
how it is transmitted, is influenced by the sender’s current emotional state, knowledge, background, 
personality, culture, and biases. Similarly, the receiver’s emotional state, knowledge, background, 
personality, culture, and biases will influence how the message is received and interpreted and will 
contribute to the barriers or noise.

This communication model and its enhancements can assist in developing communication strategies 
and plans for person-to-person or even small-group-to-small-group communications. The model is 
not useful for other communications artifacts such as emails, broadcast messages, or social media. 
Communication requirements analysis. Communication requirements analysis is an analytical 
technique used to determine the information needs of the project stakeholders through interviews, 
workshops, the study of lessons learned from previous projects, etc. Analysis of communication 
requirements determines the information needs of the project stakeholders. These requirements 
are defined by combining the type and format of information needed with an analysis of the value of 
that information. Sources of information typically used to identify and define project communication 
requirements include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
Stakeholder information and communication requirements from within the stakeholder 
register and stakeholder engagement plan; 
• 
Number of potential communication channels or paths, including one-to-one, one-to-many, 
and many-to-many communications; 
• 
Organizational charts; 
• 
Project organization and stakeholder responsibilities, relationships, and interdependencies; 
• 
Development approach; 
• 
Disciplines, departments, and specialties involved in the project; 
• 
Logistics of how many persons will be involved with the project and at which locations; 
• 
Internal information needs (e.g., when communicating within organizations); 
• 
External information needs (e.g., when communicating with the media, public, or 
contractors); and 
• 
Legal requirements. 
Communication skills. Communication skills are a collection of skills to provide, receive, and elicit 
information from various sources. Communication skills can be oral, visual, or electronic. Oral 
communication skills include interaction, presentation, active listening, and meeting facilitation. 
Visual communication skills include data visualization and nonverbal communication. Electronic 
communication skills include electronic tools such as professional writing, crafting emails, texting, 
chatting, AI prompts, and similar activities. 
Communication styles assessment. A communication styles assessment is a technique used to 
assess communication styles and identify the preferred communication method, format, and content 
for planned communication activities. Often used with unsupportive stakeholders, this assessment 
may follow a stakeholder engagement assessment to identify gaps in stakeholder engagement that 
require additional tailored communication activities and artifacts. 
Communication technology. Communication technology includes specific tools, systems, computer 
programs, etc., used to transfer information among project stakeholders. The methods used to 
transfer information among project stakeholders may vary significantly. Common methods used 
for information exchange and collaboration include conversations, meetings, written documents, 
databases, social media, and websites.

Factors that can affect the choice of communication technology may include the following: 
• 
Urgency of the need for information. The urgency, frequency, and format of the 
information to be communicated may vary from project to project and within different 
phases of a project. 
• 
Availability and reliability of technology. The technology that is required for distribution 
of project communications artifacts should be compatible, available, and accessible for all 
stakeholders throughout the project. 
• 
Ease of use. The choice of communication technologies should be suitable for project 
participants, and proper training events should be planned where appropriate. 
• 
Project environment. Factors to consider include: 
◾ 
Will the team meet and operate on a face-to-face basis or in a virtual environment? 
◾ 
Will the team be located in one or multiple time zones? 
◾ 
Will the team use multiple languages for communication? 
◾ 
Are there any other project environmental factors, such as various aspects of culture, 
that may constrain the efficiency of communication? 
• 
Sensitivity and confidentiality of the information. Some aspects to consider include: 
◾ 
Will the information to be communicated be sensitive or confidential? If so, additional 
security measures may be required. 
◾ 
Does the organization have social media policies for employees to ensure appropriate 
behavior, security, and the protection of proprietary information? 
Conflict management. Conflict is inevitable in a project environment. Sources of conflict include 
scarce resources, scheduling priorities, and personal work styles. Team ground rules, group norms, 
and solid project management practices, such as communication planning and role definition, can 
reduce the amount of conflict. 
Successful conflict management results in greater productivity and positive working relationships. 
When managed properly, differences of opinion can lead to increased creativity and better decision-
making. If the differences become a negative factor, project team members are initially responsible for 
their resolution. If conflict escalates, the project manager should help facilitate a satisfactory resolution. 
Conflict should be addressed early and usually in private, using a direct, collaborative approach. If 
disruptive conflict continues, formal procedures may be used, including disciplinary actions. 
The success of project managers in managing their project teams often depends on their ability to 
resolve conflicts. Different project managers may use different conflict resolution methods. Factors 
that influence conflict resolution methods may include: 
• 
Importance and intensity of the conflict, 
• 
Time pressure for resolving the conflict, 
• 
• 
Relative power of the people involved in the conflict, 
Importance of maintaining a good relationship, and 
• 
Motivation to resolve conflict on a long-term or short-term basis.

There are five general techniques for resolving conflict. Each technique has its place and use: 
• 
Withdraw/avoid. Retreating from an actual or potential conflict situation; postponing the 
issue to be better prepared or to be resolved by others. 
• 
Smooth/accommodate. Emphasizing areas of agreement rather than areas of difference; 
conceding one’s position to the needs of others to maintain harmony and relationships. 
• 
Compromise/reconcile. Searching for solutions that bring some degree of satisfaction to 
all parties in order to temporarily or partially resolve the conflict. This approach occasionally 
results in a lose-lose situation. 
• 
Force/direct. Pushing one’s viewpoint at the expense of others; offering only win-lose 
solutions, usually enforced through a power position to resolve an emergency. This 
approach often results in a win-lose situation. 
• 
Collaborate/problem-solve. Incorporating multiple viewpoints and insights from differing 
perspectives; requires a cooperative attitude and open dialogue that typically leads to 
consensus and commitment. This approach can result in a win-win situation. 
Constructive cost model (COCOMO). A constructive cost model is a cost-estimation model for 
effort, time, and cost, usually associated with software development projects. The source lines of 
code or function points and adjustment factors are usually used as inputs and help to predict the 
software development cost. 
Contingent response strategies. There are five strategies that may be considered for dealing with 
opportunities, as follows: 
• 
Escalate. This risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or project 
sponsor agrees that an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed 
response would exceed the project manager’s authority. Escalated opportunities are 
managed at the portfolio level, program level, or other relevant part of the organization, 
but not on the project level. The project manager determines who should be notified about 
the opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. 
It is important that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party 
in the organization. Opportunities are usually escalated to the level that matches the 
objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred. Escalated opportunities are 
not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although they may be recorded 
in the risk register for information. 
• 
Exploit. The exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the 
organization wants to ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to capture 
the benefit associated with a particular opportunity by ensuring that it definitely happens, 
increasing the probability of occurrence to 100%. Examples of exploiting responses may 
include assigning an organization’s most talented resources to the project to reduce the time 
to completion or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and duration. 
• 
Share. Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that 
it shares some of the benefit if the opportunity occurs. It is important to select the new 
owner of a shared opportunity carefully, so they are best able to capture the opportunity 
for the benefit of the project. Risk sharing often involves payment of a risk premium to the 
party taking on the opportunity. Examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing 
partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures.

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
• 
Enhance. The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or impact of an 
opportunity. Early enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the 
benefit after the opportunity has occurred. The probability of occurrence for an opportunity 
may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. Where it is not possible to increase 
probability, an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors that 
drive the size of the potential benefit. Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding 
more resources to an activity to finish early. 
• 
Accept. Accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action 
is taken. This strategy may be appropriate for low-priority opportunities. It may also be 
adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address an opportunity in any other 
way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance 
strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or 
resources to take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no 
proactive action apart from a periodic review of the opportunity to ensure that it does not 
change significantly. 
Continuous improvement. Continuous improvement is an ongoing process that focuses on 
efforts to improve processes, products, systems, or services. It involves identifying, analyzing, and 
implementing incremental improvements. Continuous improvement can use approaches such as 
plan-do-check-act (PDCA), Lean, Total Quality Management, Six Sigma, Five Focusing Steps (5FS), and 
similar methods. 
Control charts. Control charts are used to determine whether or not a process is stable or has 
predictable performance. Upper and lower specification limits are based on the requirements 
and reflect the maximum and minimum values allowed. Upper and lower control limits are 
different from specification limits. The control limits are determined using standard statistical 
calculations and principles to ultimately establish the natural capability for a stable process. The 
project manager and appropriate stakeholders may use the statistically calculated control limits 
to identify the points at which corrective action will be taken to prevent performance that remains 
outside the control limits. Control charts can be used to monitor various types of output variables. 
Although used most frequently to track repetitive activities required for producing manufactured 
lots, control charts may also be used to monitor cost and schedule variances, volume, frequency 
of scope changes, or other management results to help determine if the project management 
processes are in control. 
Cost aggregation. Cost aggregation is a cost estimate that is aggregated by work packages in 
accordance with the work breakdown structure (WBS). The work package cost estimates are then 
aggregated for the higher component levels of the WBS (such as control accounts) and, ultimately, for 
the entire project. 
Cost-benefit analysis. Cost-benefit analysis is a financial analysis method used to determine the 
benefits provided by a project against its costs. The analysis is used to estimate the strengths and 
weaknesses of alternatives in order to determine the best alternative in terms of benefits provided. A 
cost-benefit analysis can help the project manager to determine if project activities are cost-effective. 
A cost-benefit analysis compares the cost of an activity to the expected benefit. 
Cost of quality (CoQ). The cost of quality includes all costs incurred over the life of the product 
by investment in preventing nonconformance to requirements, appraisal of the product or service 
for conformance to requirements, and failure to meet requirements. The CoQ associated with a

project consists of one or more of the following costs (see Figure 5-3, which lists examples for each 
cost group): 
• 
Prevention costs. Costs related to the prevention of poor quality in products, deliverables, 
or services of the specific project. 
• 
Appraisal costs. Costs related to evaluating, measuring, auditing, and testing products, 
deliverables, or services of a specific project. 
• 
Failure costs (internal/external). Costs related to nonconformance of products, 
deliverables, or services based on the needs or expectations of the stakeholders. 
The optimal CoQ is one that reflects the appropriate balance for investing in the cost of prevention 
and appraisal to avoid failure costs. Models show that there is an optimal quality cost for projects, 
where investing in additional prevention/appraisal costs is neither beneficial nor cost-effective. 
Critical chain method. A schedule method that allows the project team to place buffers on any 
project schedule path to account for limited resources and project uncertainties. See also critical 
chain project management (CCPM). 
Critical chain project management (CCPM). A set of techniques used to promote fast execution 
and high due-date performance by aggregating task-level (or sprint-level) variability to a project 
buffer, and then allocating the project buffer only when and where needed in order to protect the 
project due date. While the concept of a project reserve or contingency is similar, the difference is 
that a critical chain buffer is in lieu of task-level or sprint-level buffers, and not in addition to them. 
CCPM uses nearly identical scheduling logic as the critical path method (CPM), as both are based on 
Section 5 – Tools and Techniques

critical path analysis, and both call for a resource-loaded and resource-leveled critical path (RLCP). 
Indeed, when identifying the longest path or chain of tasks in a project schedule, “the RLCP” is 
synonymous with “the critical chain.” 
The only meaningful difference in scheduling logic between CCPM and CPM is that CCPM also 
calculates the percentage of the project buffer remaining, and then compares it with the percentage 
of the critical chain remaining, giving all project participants a “thumb on the pulse” signal of project 
schedule performance. This signal is called the “buffer protection index (BPI),” and differs from the 
schedule performance index (SPI) from earned value management (EVM) in that BPI is designed to 
protect the project due date, whereas SPI is designed to gauge how far from the schedule baseline 
the project may be. Also, a big benefit of BPI is its use in prioritizing day-to-day tasks according to 
which ones will help protect the due dates of projects most at risk of missing them. (Note that, in 
addition to the project-level set of techniques briefly described above, CCPM also has portfolio-level 
techniques.) 
Critical path drag. Critical path drag is the amount of time that an activity on the critical path is 
adding to the project duration. Alternatively, it is the maximum amount of time that one can shorten 
the activity before it is no longer on the critical path or before its duration becomes zero. 
Critical path drag cost. Critical path drag cost is the amount by which a project’s expected return 
on investment (ROI) is reduced due to the critical path drag of a specific critical path activity. In other 
words, it is the true economic cost of a specific critical path activity, comprised of its resource cost 
plus the cost of delay (or foregone acceleration premium). 
Critical path method (CPM). Critical path method is a method used to estimate the minimum 
project duration and determine the amount of scheduling flexibility (float) on the logical network 
paths within the schedule model. The CPM identifies the critical path, which is the sequence of 
activities that determines the shortest possible duration to complete the project. This method 
involves schedule network analysis by calculating the early start (ES), early finish (EF), late start (LS), 
and late finish (LF) dates for each activity, without regard to resource limitations, by performing a 
forward and backward pass through the schedule network. 
• 
The forward pass begins at the project start and calculates the earliest possible start and 
finish dates for each activity. For example: If Activity A has an early start (ES) of Day 1 and 
a duration of 3 days, its early finish (EF) is Day 3 (calculated as EF = ES + Duration – 1). This 
means the activity would start on Day 1 and complete by the end of Day 3. 
• 
The backward pass begins at the project end and determines the latest allowable start and 
finish dates without delaying the project. For example: If an activity must finish no later than 
Day 10 (LF = 10), and it has a duration of 4 days, its late start (LS) would be Day 7 (calculated 
as LS = LF – Duration + 1). This means the latest it can start without delaying the project is 
Day 7. 
The difference between late and early dates yields the total float, which indicates how much an 
activity can be delayed without affecting the project’s finish date. Activities with zero total float form 
the critical path. Figure 5-4 illustrates a sample network. In this example, the longest path includes 
Activities A, C, and D. Thus, the sequence A–C–D is identified as the critical path. 
The resulting early and late start and finish dates do not represent the actual project schedule, but 
rather define time windows within which each activity may be executed, based on the model inputs 
such as durations, dependencies, leads, lags, and constraints.

Note: This example uses the accepted convention of the project 
Critical Path Link 
starting on Day 1 for calculating start and fnish dates. There are 
Noncritical Path Link 
other accepted conventions that may be used. 
Figure 5-4. Example of Critical Path Method 
The critical path method is also used to calculate the total and free float, or scheduling flexibility, 
for all logical paths in the network. On any network path, total float refers to the amount of time an 
activity can be delayed without delaying the project finish date or violating a constraint. Free float is 
the time an activity can be delayed without affecting the early start of its successor; for example, the 
free float for Activity B in Figure 5-4 is 5 days. 
While the critical path is usually characterized by zero total float, positive float may occur if a 
constraint is placed later than the calculated early finish (from the forward pass). Conversely, 
negative float occurs when constraints force dates earlier than logic and duration allow. Negative 
float analysis can be used to explore acceleration strategies. 
Some schedule networks may have multiple near-critical paths, and many software tools allow users 
to define how criticality is measured. Adjustments to activity durations, logical relationships, leads 
and lags, or constraints may be necessary to bring float values to zero or positive levels. 
Critical thinking. Critical thinking is the ability to objectively question, analyze, interpret, evaluate, 
and judge information to make reasonable decisions. Throughout the various project management 
performance domains, there is a need to recognize bias, identify the root cause of problems, and 
consider challenging issues such as ambiguity and complexity. Critical thinking helps to accomplish 
these activities. Critical thinking includes disciplined, rational, logical, and evidence-based thinking. 
This approach requires an open mind and the ability to analyze objectively. Critical thinking, 
especially when applied to discovery, can include conceptual imagination, insight, and intuition; 
it can also include reflective thinking and metacognition (thinking about thinking and being aware of 
one’s awareness).

Cultural awareness. Cultural awareness is an understanding of the differences among individuals, 
groups, and organizations and adapting the project’s communication strategy in the context of these 
differences. This awareness and any consequent actions can minimize misunderstandings and 
miscommunication that may result from cultural differences within the project’s stakeholder community. 
Cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity help the project manager to plan communications based on 
the cultural differences and requirements of stakeholders and team members. 
Customer talks and tests. Customer talks and tests consist of the collaborative processes and 
activities involving direct interaction and feedback from customers during the development and 
testing phases of a project. These practices are integral to ensuring that the final product or service 
aligns with customer expectations and requirements. By engaging customers early and throughout 
the project life cycle, organizations can enhance transparency, build trust, and improve the overall 
quality of the deliverables. 
Daily coordination meeting. A daily coordination meeting is a brief, daily collaboration meeting 
in which the team reviews progress from the previous day, declares intentions for the current day, 
and highlights any obstacles encountered or anticipated. Daily coordination meetings are a key tool 
used to enable the project team to self-direct and self-manage project work, particularly in agile 
approaches to project management. The primary goal is to increase visibility, foster collaboration, 
and ensure that the team is aligned and moving forward effectively. 
• 
Short and focused. Daily coordination meetings are typically brief, lasting no more than 
15 minutes. This brevity helps ensure that the meeting remains focused and efficient. 
• 
Progress updates. Team members share what they accomplished the previous day, what 
they plan to do today, and any obstacles they are facing. This structure helps to keep 
everyone informed about the current status of the project. 
• 
Obstacle identification. By discussing obstacles or blockers, the team can quickly identify 
issues that should be addressed, allowing for timely problem-solving and support. 
• 
Accountability. Regular updates create a sense of accountability among team members, 
as they commit to specific tasks and report on their progress daily. 
• 
Collaboration and communication. Daily coordination meetings enhance communication 
within the team, fostering a collaborative environment where team members can support 
one another and work together more effectively. 
Data analysis. Data analysis is a process that involves data preprocessing, cleaning, transforming, 
analyzing, interpreting, and visualization in order to discover insights for informed and data-driven 
project decision-making. Data analysis can be done manually by project team members or other 
dedicated functions or by including business intelligence tools and software. 
Data gathering. Data gathering is a process of selecting, collecting, measuring, and analyzing data based 
on the area of interest or variables (e.g., to answer relevant project-related questions or outcomes). 
Data representation. Data representation is the way that data is stored, processed, and 
transmitted. Data representation can include but is not limited to the following: 
• 
Pie chart or circle chart for nominal data representation. Nominal data can be 
categorized (e.g., it can be a mode of transportation such as a car, train, bus, or bicycle). 
Licensed To: Timon Kevenaar PMI Member ID: 12290374. This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.


--- Page 268 ---

 
• 
Bar chart or bar graph for ordinal data. Ordinal data can be grouped into categories 
based on natural order or hierarchy (e.g., level of education such as high school diploma, 
bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, doctorate degree). 
• 
Histogram for discrete data. Discrete data will usually have limited, finite value numbers 
(e.g., product reviews). 
• 
Line graph or line chart for continuous data. Continuous data can take any value (e.g., 
temperature). 
Decision-making. Decision-making techniques include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
Voting. Voting is a collective decision-making technique and an assessment process 
having multiple alternatives with an expected outcome in the form of future actions. These 
techniques can be used to generate, classify, and prioritize product requirements. Examples 
of voting techniques include: 
◾ 
Unanimity. A decision that is reached whereby everyone agrees on a single course of 
action. 
◾ 
Majority. A decision that is reached with support obtained from more than 50% of the 
members of the group. Having a group size with an uneven number of participants can 
ensure that a decision will be reached rather than resulting in a tie. 
◾ 
Plurality. A decision that is reached whereby the largest block in a group decides, even 
if a majority is not achieved. This method is generally used when the number of options 
nominated is more than two. 
• 
Autocratic decision-making. In this method, one individual takes responsibility for making 
the decision for the group. 
• 
Multicriteria decision analysis. A technique that uses a decision matrix to provide a 
systematic, analytical approach for establishing criteria, such as risk levels, uncertainty, and 
valuation, to evaluate and rank many ideas. 
Decision tree analysis. Decision tree analysis is a diagramming and calculation technique 
for evaluating the implications of a chain of multiple options in the presence of uncertainty. 
Decision trees are used to support selection of the best of several alternative courses of action. 
Alternative paths through the project are shown in the decision tree using branches representing 
different decisions or events, each of which can have associated costs and related individual 
project risks (including both threats and opportunities). The end points of branches in the 
decision tree represent the outcome from following that particular path, which can be negative 
or positive. 
The decision tree is evaluated by calculating the expected monetary value of each branch, allowing 
the optimal path to be selected. An example decision tree is shown in Figure 5-5. 
Decomposition. Decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope 
and project deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts. The work package is the work defined 
at the lowest level of the work breakdown structure (WBS) for which cost and duration can be 
estimated and managed. The level of decomposition is often guided by the degree of control needed 
to effectively manage the project. The level of detail for work packages varies depending on the size

Note 2: The decision tree shows how to make a decision between alternative capital strategies (represented as “decision 
nodes”) when the environment contains uncertain elements (represented as “chance nodes”). 
Note 3: Here, a decision is being made whether to invest $120M to build a new plant or to instead invest only $50M 
to upgrade the existing plant. For each decision, the demand (which is uncertain, and therefore represents a 
“chance node”) should be accounted for. For example, strong demand leads to $200M revenue with the new plant 
but only $120M for the upgraded plant, perhaps due to capacity limitations of the upgraded plant. The end of 
each branch shows the net effect of the payoffs minus costs. For each decision branch, all effects are added (see 
shaded areas) to determine the overall expected monetary value (EMV) of the decision. Remember to account for 
the investment costs. From the calculations in the shaded areas, the upgraded plant has a higher EMV of $46M— 
also the EMV of the overall decision. (This choice also represents the lowest risk, avoiding the worst-case possible  
outcome of a loss of $30M.)

and complexity of the project. Decomposition of the total project work into work packages generally 
involves the following activities: 
• 
Identifying and analyzing the deliverables and related work, 
• 
Structuring and organizing the WBS, 
• 
Decomposing the upper WBS levels into lower-level detailed components, 
• 
Developing and assigning identification codes to the WBS components, and 
• 
Verifying that the degree of decomposition of the deliverables is appropriate. 
A portion of a WBS with some branches of the WBS decomposed down through the work package 
level is shown in Figure 5-6.

Using phases of the project life cycle as the second level of decomposition, with the product 
and project deliverables inserted at the third level, as shown in Figure 5-7; 
• 
Using major deliverables as the second level of decomposition, as shown in Figure 5-8; and 
• 
Incorporating subcomponents that may be developed by organizations outside the project 
team, such as contracted work. The seller then develops the supporting contract WBS as 
part of the contracted work. 
Figure 5-6. Sample WBS Decomposed Down Through Work Packages 
A WBS structure may be created through various approaches. Some of the popular methods include 
the top-down approach, the use of organization-specific guidelines, and the use of WBS templates. 
A bottom-up approach can be used to group subcomponents. The WBS structure can be represented 
in various forms, such as: 
Decomposition of the upper-level WBS components requires subdividing the work for each of 
the deliverables or subcomponents into its most fundamental components, where the WBS 
components represent verifiable products, services, or results. If an agile approach is used, epics can 
be decomposed into user stories. The WBS may be structured as an outline, organizational chart, 
or other method that identifies a hierarchical breakdown. Verifying the correctness of the 
decomposition requires determining that the lower-level WBS components are those that are 
necessary and sufficient for completion of the corresponding higher-level deliverables. Different 
deliverables can have different levels of decomposition. 
To arrive at a work package, the work for some deliverables should be decomposed only to the 
next level, while others may require additional levels of decomposition. As the work is decomposed

to greater levels of detail, the ability to plan, manage, and control the work is enhanced. However, 
excessive decomposition can lead to a nonproductive management effort, inefficient use of 
resources, decreased efficiency in performing the work, and difficulty aggregating data over different 
levels of the WBS. 
Decomposition may not be possible for a deliverable or subcomponent that will be accomplished far 
into the future. The project management team usually waits until the deliverable or subcomponent is 
agreed on so that the details of the WBS can be developed. This technique is sometimes referred to 
as rolling wave planning. 
The WBS represents all product and project work, including the project management work. The total 
of the work at the lowest levels should roll up to the higher levels so that nothing is left out and no 
extra work is performed. This is sometimes called the 100 percent rule. 
For specific information regarding the WBS, refer to the Practice Standard for Work Breakdown 
Structures [4]. The practice standard contains industry-specific examples of WBS templates that 
can be tailored to specific projects in a particular application area. 
Dependency determination and integration. Dependencies may be characterized by the following 
attributes: mandatory or discretionary and internal or external. Dependency has four attributes, but 
two can be applicable at the same time in the following ways: mandatory external dependencies, 
mandatory internal dependencies, discretionary external dependencies, or discretionary internal 
dependencies.

• 
Mandatory dependencies. Mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or 
contractually required or inherent in the nature of the work. Mandatory dependencies 
often involve physical limitations, such as on a construction project, where it is impossible 
to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built, or on an electronics 
project, where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. Mandatory dependencies 
are sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. Technical dependencies 
may not be mandatory. The project team determines which dependencies are mandatory 
during the process of sequencing the activities. Mandatory dependencies should not be 
confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool. 
• 
Discretionary dependencies. Discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as 
preferred logic, preferential logic, or soft logic. Discretionary dependencies are established 
based on knowledge of good practices within a particular application area or some unusual 
aspect of the project where a specific sequence is desired, even though there may be other 
acceptable sequences. For example, generally accepted good practices recommend that 
during construction, the electrical work should start after finishing the plumbing work. 
This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time (in parallel); 
however, performing the activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk. 
Discretionary dependencies should be fully documented since they can create arbitrary 
total float values and can limit later scheduling options. When fast tracking techniques 
are employed, these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered

for modification or removal. The project team determines which dependencies are 
discretionary during the process of sequencing the activities. 
• 
External dependencies. External dependencies involve a relationship between project 
activities and non-project activities. These dependencies are usually outside of the project 
team’s control. For example, the testing activity in a software project may be dependent on 
the delivery of hardware from an external source, or governmental environmental hearings 
may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction project. The 
project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process 
of sequencing the activities. 
• 
Internal dependencies. Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between 
project activities and are generally inside the project team’s control. For example, if 
the team cannot test a machine until they assemble it, there is an internal mandatory 
dependency. The project management team determines which dependencies are internal 
during the process of sequencing the activities. 
Design thinking. Design thinking is a nonlinear, iterative process that teams use to understand 
users, challenge assumptions, redefine problems, and create innovative solutions to prototype and 
test. Design thinking is a human-centered needs analysis process, popularly used for new product 
development projects. The process encourages collaboration and the exploration of different ideas 
with a focus on customer experience, and is performed using several iterative activities such as 
defining the problem, ideating options, prototyping, and testing. 
Distributed management and leadership. This management structure emphasizes teamwork 
and empowered individuals. As opposed to centralized management and leadership, a distributed 
management and leadership structure means that decision-making and authority are decentralized 
and distributed among various individuals and teams. Sometimes project management activities 
are shared among a project management team, and project team members are responsible for 
completing the work. There are also situations where a project team may self-organize to complete 
a project. Rather than having a designated project manager, someone within the project team may 
serve as facilitator to enable communication, collaboration, and engagement. This role may shift 
among project team members. See also centralized management and leadership. 
Document analysis. Document analysis consists of reviewing and assessing any relevant 
documented information. There is a wide range of documents that may be analyzed. Examples of 
documents that may be analyzed include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
Agreements and contracts; 
• 
Business plans, processes, or interface documentation; 
• 
Business rules repositories; 
• 
Current process flows; 
• 
Marketing literature; 
• 
Plans, assumptions, constraints, historical files, and technical documentation; 
•

Use cases. 
Earned value (EV) analysis. Earned value analysis compares the performance measurement 
baseline to the actual schedule and cost performance. Earned value management (EVM) integrates 
the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedule baseline to form the performance 
measurement baseline. EVM develops and monitors three key dimensions for each work package 
and control account: 
• 
Planned value (PV). PV is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. It is the 
authorized budget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work 
breakdown structure (WBS) component, not including management reserve. This budget 
is allocated by phase over the life of the project, but at a given point in time. PV defines 
the physical work that should have been accomplished. The total of the PV is sometimes 
referred to as the performance measurement baseline (PMB). The total PV for the project is 
also known as budget at completion (BAC). 
• 
Earned value (EV). EV is the measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget 
authorized for that work. It is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been 
completed. The EV being measured should be related to the PMB, and the EV measured 
cannot be greater than the authorized PV budget for a component. The EV is often used 
to calculate the percent complete of a project. Progress measurement criteria should be 
established for each WBS component to measure work in progress. Project managers 
monitor EV, both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine 
the long-term performance trends. 
• 
Actual cost (AC). AC is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during 
a specific time period. The AC is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the 
EV measured. The AC should correspond in definition to what was budgeted in the PV and 
measured in the EV (e.g., direct hours only, direct costs only, or all costs including indirect 
costs). The AC will have no upper limit; whatever is spent to achieve the EV will be measured. 
There are tools and techniques that can be applied to calculate the EVM for projects carried out with 
an adaptive approach (see The Standard for Earned Value Management, p. 91) [3]. 
In adaptive approaches, effort can be expressed through story points. The result is a calculation of EV 
and PV for the different iterations that is based on the story points assigned to each user story. The 
PV is the amount of story points estimated for the user stories planned until a certain date, usually 
the end of the iteration, and EV represents the story points estimated for the user stories that are 
considered done at the end of the same iteration. The AC value is related to the costs for the team 
working on the user stories during the iteration, usually derived from the working hours. 
Emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify, assess, and manage the 
personal emotions of oneself and other people, as well as the collective emotions of groups of 
people. A project team can use emotional intelligence to reduce tension and increase cooperation 
by identifying, assessing, and controlling the sentiments of project team members, anticipating their 
actions, acknowledging their concerns, and following up on their issues.

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
A project manager should invest in their personal emotional intelligence by improving inbound (e.g., 
self-management and self-awareness) and outbound (e.g., relationship management) competencies. 
Research suggests that project teams that succeed in developing team emotional intelligence or 
become an emotionally competent group are more effective. Additionally, there is usually a reduction 
in staff turnover. See also leadership. 
Estimation techniques. Estimating is a process of determining the time and resources needed 
to complete the project. Estimation techniques involve various methods for forecasting variables. 
Estimating techniques can be qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative estimating techniques involve 
estimates based on understanding processes, behaviors, and conditions that individuals or groups 
perceive. Qualitative estimating techniques can be used together with quantitative methods. 
Quantitative estimating techniques include numerical estimates of effort, duration, or cost. The most 
common estimation techniques include the following: 
• 
Expert judgment (see expert judgment), 
• 
Analogous estimating (see analogous estimating), 
• 
Bottom-up estimating (see bottom-up estimating), 
• 
Multipoint estimating (see multipoint estimating), 
• 
Parametric estimating (see parametric estimating), and 
• 
Relative size estimation (see relative size estimation). 
Expert judgment. Expert judgment is judgment provided based upon expertise in an application 
area, discipline, industry, etc., as appropriate for the activity being performed. Such expertise may be 
provided by any group or person with specialized education, knowledge, skill, experience, or training. 
Facilitation. Facilitation is the ability to effectively guide a group event to a successful decision, 
solution, or conclusion. A facilitator helps ensure the following: 
• 
There is effective participation, 
• 
Participants achieve a mutual understanding, 
• 
All contributions are considered, 
• 
Conclusions or results have full buy-in according to the decision process established for the 
project, and 
• 
Actions and agreements that are achieved are appropriately dealt with afterward. 
Feedback. Feedback is information about reactions to communications, a deliverable, or a situation. 
Feedback supports interactive communication among the project manager, project team, and all 
other project stakeholders. Examples include coaching, mentoring, and negotiating. 
Financing. Financing entails acquiring funding for projects. It is common for long-term infrastructure, 
industrial, and public services projects to seek external sources of funds. If a project is funded 
externally, the funding entity may have certain requirements that must be met. 
Flowchart. Flowcharts are visual representations that map out the sequence of steps and branching 
possibilities within a process. They are also known as process maps and are used to transform one 
or more inputs into one or more outputs. Flowcharts are instrumental in illustrating the activities,

--- Page 276 ---

decision points, branching loops, parallel paths, and overall order of processing within a horizontal 
value chain. This visualization helps in understanding the operational details of procedures and can 
be particularly useful in project management for outlining processes and identifying potential areas 
for improvement. 
Focus groups. Focus groups are an elicitation technique that brings together prequalified 
stakeholders and subject matter experts to learn about their expectations and attitudes about a 
proposed product, service, or result. A trained moderator guides the group through an interactive 
discussion designed to be more conversational than a one-on-one interview. 
Funding limit reconciliation. Funding limit reconciliation is the process of reconciling the 
expenditure of funds with any funding limits on the commitment of funds for the project. A 
variance between the funding limits and the planned expenditures will sometimes necessitate the 
rescheduling of work to level out the rate of expenditures. This leveling is accomplished by placing 
imposed date constraints for work into the project schedule. 
Genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms are an optimization technique and iterative process inspired 
by natural selection to find solutions to complex problems. Genetic algorithms can be utilized for 
project optimization, exploring all possible decision combinations without human bias. For example, 
it can be used in project scheduling and resource management as a tool for developing scheduling 
strategies, resolving issues related to scheduling conflicts, resource leveling and constraints, and 
critical path planning. Genetic algorithms are a specific type of metaheuristic method. 
Green human resource management. Green human resource management is a set of people 
management policies and practices that focuses on the sustainable use of resources, preserving 
the natural environment, and improving environmental performance. For example, green human 
resource management can involve incorporating green practices while considering project team 
member recruitment and selection, training and development, performance management, and 
compensation and rewards, as well as reviewing project team members’ involvement with green 
practices when performing individual and team assessments. 
Ground rules. Ground rules are expectations regarding acceptable behavior by project team 
members. Defined in the team charter, ground rules set the expected behavior for project team 
members and other stakeholders with regard to stakeholder engagement. 
Hierarchical charts. Hierarchical charts are a traditional organizational chart structure that can be 
used to show positions and relationships in a graphical, top-down format. Other hierarchical charts 
include the following: 
• 
Work breakdown structure (WBS). A WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total 
scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives 
and create the required deliverables. The WBS is designed to show how project deliverables 
are broken down into work packages and provides a way of showing high-level areas of 
responsibility. 
• 
Organizational breakdown structure (OBS). An OBS is a hierarchical representation of 
the project organization that illustrates the relationship between project activities and the 
organizational units that will perform those activities. While the WBS shows a breakdown 
of project deliverables, an OBS is arranged according to an organization’s existing 
departments, units, or teams, with the project activities or work packages listed under each 
Section 5 – Tools and Techniques

department. An operational department, such as information technology or purchasing, 
can see all of its project responsibilities by looking at its portion of the OBS. 
• 
Resource breakdown structure. A resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical 
representation of resources by category and type. The resource breakdown structure is 
used for planning, managing, and controlling project work. Each descending (lower) level 
represents an increasingly detailed description of the resource until the information is small 
enough to be used in conjunction with the WBS to allow the work to be planned, monitored, 
and controlled. 
• 
Value breakdown structure (VBS). A VBS is a WBS with value estimates assigned to 
each element. The VBS can be useful in determining whether a given scope element is 
truly mandatory—that is, equal to the value of the entire project, as removing that scope 
element would erase the value of the project. When a VBS element is on the critical path, it 
can be useful to help assess whether a higher-value baseline may exist (e.g., when the value 
of accelerating or removing a given VBS element might exceed the cost of doing so). 
Historical information review. Reviewing historical information can assist in developing parametric 
estimates or analogous estimates. Historical information may include project characteristics 
(parameters) to develop mathematical models to predict total project costs. Such models may be 
simple (e.g., residential home construction is based on a certain cost per square foot of space) 
or complex (e.g., one model of software development costing uses multiple separate adjustment 
factors, each of which has numerous points within it). 
Both the cost and accuracy of analogous and parametric models can vary widely. They are most likely 
to be reliable when: 
• 
Historical information used to develop the model is accurate; 
• 
Parameters used in the model are readily quantifiable; and 
• 
Models are scalable, such that they work for large projects, small projects, and phases of a 
project. 
Individual and team assessments. Individual and team assessment tools give the project manager 
and the project team insight into areas of strengths and weaknesses. These tools help project 
managers assess team members’ preferences and aspirations, as well as how they process and 
organize information, make decisions, and interact with people. Various tools are available such as 
attitudinal surveys, specific assessments, structured interviews, ability tests, and focus groups. These 
tools can provide improved understanding, trust, commitment, and communication among team 
members and facilitate more productive teams throughout the project. 
Influence diagrams. Influence diagrams are graphical representations of situations that can be 
used when making decisions under uncertainty. They show causal influences, time ordering of 
events, and other relationships among variables and outcomes. An influence diagram represents a 
project or situation within the project as a set of entities, outcomes, and influences, together with 
the relationships and effects among them. Where an element in the influence diagram is uncertain 
as a result of the existence of individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty, this can be 
represented in the influence diagram using ranges or probability distributions. The influence diagram 
is then evaluated using a simulation technique, such as Monte Carlo analysis, to indicate which 
elements have the greatest influence on key outcomes. Outputs from an influence diagram are 
similar to other quantitative risk analysis methods, including S-curve diagrams and tornado diagrams.

Influencing. Because project managers often have little or no direct authority over team members 
in a matrix environment, their ability to influence stakeholders on a timely basis is critical to project 
success. Key influencing skills include the following: 
• 
Ability to be persuasive; 
• 
Clearly articulating points and positions; 
• 
High levels of active and effective listening skills; 
• 
Awareness of, and consideration for, the various perspectives in any situation; and 
• 
Gathering relevant information to address issues and reach agreements while maintaining 
mutual trust. 
Information management. Information management tools and techniques are used to create and 
connect people to information. These tools are effective for sharing simple, unambiguous, codified 
explicit knowledge. The tools include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
Methods for codifying explicit knowledge (e.g., for producing lessons-to-be-learned entries 
for the lessons learned register); 
• 
Lessons learned register; 
• 
Library services; 
• 
Information gathering (e.g., web searches and reading published articles); and 
• 
Project management information system (PMIS), which often includes document 
management systems. 
Tools and techniques that connect people to information can be enhanced by adding an element of 
interaction (e.g., including a “contact me” function so users can get in touch with the originators of the 
lessons and ask for advice specific to their project and context). 
Interaction and support also help people to find relevant information. Asking for help is generally 
quicker and easier than trying to identify search terms. Search terms are often difficult to select 
because people may not know which keywords or phrases to use to access the information they 
need. 
Knowledge and information management tools and techniques should be connected to project 
processes and process owners. Communities of practice and subject matter experts, for example, 
may generate insights that lead to improved control processes (having an internal sponsor can 
ensure improvements are implemented). Lessons learned entries may be analyzed to identify 
common issues that can be addressed by changes to project procedures. 
Information radiators. An information radiator is a visible, physical display that provides 
information to the rest of the organization, enabling timely knowledge sharing. Information 
radiators may also be known as big visible charts. Information radiators are posted in a place 
where people can see the information easily, rather than having information in a scheduling 
or reporting tool. The information radiators should be easy to update and should be updated 
frequently. They are often “low tech and high touch” in that they are manually maintained rather 
than electronically generated. Figure 5-9 shows an information radiator associated with work 
completed, work remaining, and risks.

In-progress postmortems. An in-progress postmortem is a structured process conducted at various 
stages of the project life cycle to analyze current performance, identify issues, and implement 
improvements. Unlike traditional postmortems held at the end of a project, these reviews are 
conducted periodically to ensure continuous improvement and timely problem-solving. 
Inspections. An inspection is the examination of a work product to determine if it conforms to 
documented standards. The results of inspections generally include measurements and may be conducted 
at any level. The results of a single activity can be inspected or the final product of the project can be 
inspected. Inspections may be called reviews, peer reviews, audits, or walkthroughs. In some application 
areas, these terms have narrow and specific meanings. Inspections also are used to verify defect repairs. 
Integrated change control. Integrated change control helps ensure that changes to the project are 
managed in a coordinated and controlled manner. By evaluating change requests, conducting impact 
analyses, making informed decisions, and documenting and communicating changes, the project can 
maintain alignment with its objectives and constraints, ultimately contributing to project success. 
Interpersonal and team skills. Interpersonal skills that are used frequently in projects include 
emotional intelligence, decision-making, facilitation, and conflict management and resolution, among 
others. (See emotional intelligence; decision-making; conflict management.) As for team management, 
this effort entails applying knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques for management activities as well

as leadership activities. Management activities focus on the means of meeting project objectives, such 
as having effective processes, planning, coordinating, measuring, and monitoring work, among others. 
Leadership activities focus on people. Leadership includes influencing, motivating, listening, enabling, 
and other activities having to do with the project team. Both are important in delivering the intended 
outcomes. See also centralized management and leadership and distributed management and leadership. 
Interviews. Interviews are a formal or informal approach to elicit information from stakeholders 
by talking to them directly. Interviews are typically performed by asking prepared and spontaneous 
questions and recording responses. Interviews are often conducted on an individual basis 
between an interviewer and an interviewee but may involve multiple interviewers and/or multiple 
interviewees. Interviewing experienced project participants, sponsors, executives, and subject 
matter experts can aid in identifying and defining the features and functions of the desired product 
deliverables. Interviews are also useful for obtaining confidential information. 
Iteration burndown chart. An iteration burndown tracks the work that remains to be completed 
in the iteration backlog. An iteration burndown chart is used to analyze the variance with respect to 
an ideal burndown based on the work committed from iteration planning. A forecast trend line can 
be used to predict the likely variance at iteration completion and take appropriate actions during the 
course of the iteration. A diagonal line representing the ideal burndown and daily actual remaining 
work is then plotted. A trend line is then calculated to forecast completion based on the remaining 
work. Figure 5-10 is an example of an iteration burndown chart. 
Knowledge management. Knowledge management tools and techniques connect people so they 
can work together to create new knowledge, share tacit knowledge, and integrate the knowledge of 
diverse team members. The tools and techniques appropriate in a project depend on the nature of 
the project, especially the degree of innovation involved, project complexity, and the level of diversity 
(including diversity of disciplines) among team members.

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
Knowledge management tools and techniques include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
Networking, including informal social interaction and online social networking (Online 
forums where people can ask open questions such as: “What does anyone know about . . .?” 
are useful for starting knowledge-sharing conversations with specialists.); 
• 
Communities of practice (sometimes called communities of interest or just communities) 
and special interest groups;

Leadership. Leadership encompasses the knowledge, skills, and behaviors needed to guide, 
motivate, and direct a team to help an organization achieve its business goals. These skills may 
include demonstrating essential capabilities such as negotiation, resilience, communication, 
problem-solving, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills. Projects are becoming increasingly more 
complicated with more and more businesses executing their strategy through projects. Project 
management is more than just working with numbers, templates, charts, graphs, and computing 
systems. A common denominator in all projects is people. People can be counted, but they are 
not numbers. 
Leadership skills are useful for all project team members, whether the project team is operating in an 
environment with a centralized authority or a shared leadership environment. The following sections 
describe some of the traits and activities associated with leadership: 
• 
Establishing and maintaining vision. Every project has a purpose. Understanding that 
purpose is critical for people to commit their time and energy in the right direction toward 
achieving the project purpose. The project vision summarizes the project’s purpose 
clearly and succinctly. The vision describes a realistic, attractive view of the future project 
outcomes. In addition to briefly describing the desired future state, the vision is a powerful 
motivational tool. It is a way to create passion and meaning for a project’s envisioned 
goal. A common vision helps keep people pulling in the same direction. When immersed 
in the details of everyday work, a clear understanding of the end goal can help guide local 
decisions toward the desired project outcome. 
◾ 
A vision developed collaboratively between project team members and key 
stakeholders should answer these questions: 
▶ 
What is the project purpose? 
▶ 
What defines successful project work? 
▶ 
How will the future be better when the project outcomes are delivered? 
▶ 
How will the project team know that it is drifting from the vision?

◾ 
A good vision is clear, concise, and actionable. It does the following: 
▶ 
Summarizes the project with a powerful phrase or short description; 
▶ 
Describes the best achievable outcome; 
▶ 
Creates a common, cohesive picture in project team members’ minds; and 
▶ 
Inspires passion for the outcome. 
• 
Critical thinking. Critical thinking, especially when applied to discovery, can include 
conceptual imagination, insight, and intuition. Project team members apply critical thinking 
to do the following: 
◾ 
Research and gather unbiased, well-balanced information; 
◾ 
Recognize, analyze, and resolve problems; 
◾ 
Identify bias, unstated assumptions, and values; 
◾ 
Discern the use of language and its influence on oneself and others; 
◾ 
Analyze data and evidence to evaluate arguments and perspectives; 
◾ 
Observe events to identify patterns and relationships; 
◾ 
Apply inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning appropriately; and 
◾ 
Identify and articulate false premises, false analogy, emotional appeals, and other 
faulty logic (for more information, see critical thinking). 
• 
Motivation. Motivating project team members has two aspects: The first is understanding 
what motivates project team members to perform, and the second is working with project 
team members in such a way that they remain committed to the project and its outcomes 
(for more information, see motivation). 
• 
Interpersonal skills. Interpersonal skills that are used frequently in projects include 
emotional intelligence, decision-making, and conflict resolution, among others. 
◾ 
Emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify, assess, and 
manage the personal emotions of oneself and other people, as well as the collective 
emotions of groups of people. There are multiple models for defining and explaining 
emotional intelligence. Figure 5-11 shows the key points for each of the four aspects of 
emotional intelligence and how they relate. The aspects having to do with oneself are 
on the top, and the social aspects are on the bottom. Awareness is on the left side, and 
management and skill are on the right side. 
 
Emotional intelligence models converge on four key areas: 
▶ 
Self-awareness. Self-awareness is the ability to conduct a realistic self-assessment. 
This ability includes understanding our own emotions, goals, motivations, 
strengths, and weaknesses. 
▶ 
Self-management. Self-management, also known as self-regulation, is the ability to 
control and redirect disruptive feelings and impulses. It is the ability to think before 
acting, suspending snap judgments and impulsive decisions. 
▶ 
Social awareness. Social awareness is about empathy and understanding and 
considering other people’s feelings. This key area includes the ability to read 
nonverbal cues and body language.

▶ 
Social skills. Social skills are the culmination of the other dimensions of emotional 
intelligence. Social skills are concerned with managing groups of people, such 
as project teams, building social networks, finding common ground with various 
stakeholders, and building rapport. 
Self-awareness and self-management skills are required to remain calm and productive 
during difficult project circumstances. Social awareness and social skills allow for better 
bonds with project team members and project stakeholders. Emotional intelligence is a 
basis of all forms of leadership. 
• 
Decision-making. Project managers and project teams make many decisions daily. Some 
decisions may be fairly inconsequential to the project outcome, such as where to go for a 
team lunch, and others will be very impactful, such as what development approach to use, 
which tool to use, or what vendor to select. 
◾ 
Decisions can be made unilaterally. This has the advantage of being fast but is prone 
to errors when compared to engaging the wisdom of a diverse set of people. Unilateral 
decision-making can also demotivate people who are impacted by the decision since 
they may feel their views and concerns were not considered. 
◾ 
Group-based decision-making has the benefit of tapping into the broad knowledge 
base of a group. Engaging people in the decision-making process also increases buy-in 
Licensed To: Timon Kevenaar PMI Member ID: 12290374. This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.


--- Page 284 ---

of the outcome, even if the option selected may not have been everyone’s first choice. 
Generally, inclusion increases commitment to the decision. The downside of group 
decision-making is the time required and the interruption to the team’s work that can 
occur when members are consulted about a decision. 
◾ 
Project team decision-making often follows a diverge/converge pattern. This pattern 
means that stakeholders are first engaged to generate a broad set of solution 
alternatives or approaches. This work is often done individually to avoid the effect 
of senior or charismatic stakeholders unduly influencing other stakeholders. Then, 
after a broad spectrum of decision alternatives has been generated, the project team 
converges on a preferred solution. 
◾ 
The goal is to make decisions quickly while engaging the diverse knowledge of a group in 
an inclusive and respectful manner. Some decisions may be made in a different direction 
than some people prefer, but everyone has an opportunity to explain their position. In 
the end, the deciding authority, whether an individual or a group, makes a decision based 
on the presented analysis and with consideration for stakeholder expectations. 
◾ 
Careful selection of which decisions should go for group discussion and using voting 
can limit the interruptions and task switching experienced by the project team. Many 
approaches such as Roman voting, wideband Delphi estimating, and fist of five voting 
use the diverge/converge pattern. These approaches aim to engage individual input 
while voting at the same moment, which minimizes groupthink. 
◾ 
For those decisions that are beyond the authority of the project team to decide, the 
project team can investigate alternatives, consider impacts of each alternative, and 
escalate the decision to someone with the proper authority. This process aligns with the 
philosophy of “do not bring me problems, bring me solutions” while remaining aligned 
with organizational governance regarding decision-making authority. 
• 
Conflict management. Addressing conflict before it escalates beyond useful debate leads 
to better outcomes. The following approaches can help: 
◾ 
Keep communication open and respectful. Because conflict can cause anxiety, it is 
important to keep a safe environment to explore the source of the conflict. Without a 
safe environment, people will stop communicating. Make sure words, tone of voice, and 
body language remain nonthreatening. 
◾ 
Focus on the issues, not the people. Conflict is based on people perceiving situations 
differently. Conflicts should not be personal. The focus is on resolving the situation, not 
casting blame. 
◾ 
Focus on the present and future, not the past. Stay focused on the current situation, 
not past situations. If something similar happened previously, bringing up the past will 
not resolve the current situation. In fact, it can further intensify the current situation. 
 
Search for alternatives together. Damage incurred from conflict can be repaired by 
looking for resolutions and alternatives together. This collaboration can also create more 
constructive relationships. This effort to resolve the problem moves the conflict into a 
problem-solving space where people can work together to generate creative alternatives 
(for more information, see conflict management). 
Leads and lags. A lead is the amount of time whereby a successor activity can be advanced with 
respect to a predecessor activity. For example, on a project to construct a new office building, the

landscaping could be scheduled to start 2 weeks prior to the scheduled punch list completion. This 
activity would be shown as a finish-to-start (FS) with a 2-week lead as shown in Figure 5-12. A lead is 
often represented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software. 
A lag is the amount of time whereby a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor 
activity. For example, a technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document 
15 days after they begin writing it. This can be shown as a start-to-start (SS) relationship with a 15-day 
lag as shown in Figure 5-12. 
The project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to 
accurately define the logical relationship. The use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic. 
Also, duration estimates do not include any leads or lags. Activities and their related assumptions 
should be documented. 
Leads and lags can also be represented in project schedule network diagrams. For more details, see 
the entry for project schedule network diagrams in Section 4. 
Logical relationship. A logical relationship is a dependency between two activities or between an 
activity and a milestone. The four most common types of logical relationships are finish-to-start, 
finish-to-finish, start-to-start, and start-to-finish. See also precedence diagramming method. 
Make-or-buy analysis and decisions. Make-or-buy analysis is the decision-making process of 
gathering and organizing data about product requirements and analyzing them against available 
alternatives, including the purchase or internal manufacture of the product. A make-or-buy analysis 
results in a make-or-buy decision as to whether particular work can be best accomplished by the 
project team or if it should be purchased from outside sources. 
Market research. Market research is a data-gathering technique that includes examination of 
industry and specific seller capabilities. Procurement teams may leverage information gained at 
conferences, online reviews, and a variety of sources to identify market capabilities. The team may 
also refine specific procurement objectives to leverage maturing technologies while balancing risks 
associated with the breadth of sellers who can provide the desired materials or services.

Meeting management. Meeting management is an interpersonal and team skill used to ensure 
meetings meet their intended objectives effectively and efficiently. The following steps should be 
used for meeting planning: 
• 
Prepare and distribute the agenda stating the objectives of the meeting; 
• 
Ensure that the meeting starts and finishes at the published time; 
• 
Ensure the appropriate participants are invited and attend; 
• 
Stay on topic; 
• 
Manage expectations, issues, and conflicts during the meeting; and 
• 
Record all actions along with the individual who has responsibility for completing the action. 
Meetings. Project meetings can include virtual or face-to-face meetings and can be supported with 
document collaboration technologies such as email messages and project websites. Examples of 
meetings include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
Decision-making, 
• 
Facilitated workshops, 
• 
Issue resolution, 
• 
Lessons learned and retrospectives, 
• 
Project kickoffs, 
• 
Sprint planning, and 
• 
Status updates. 
Mind mapping. Mind mapping is a technique used to consolidate ideas created through individual 
brainstorming sessions into a single map to reflect commonality and differences in understanding and 
to generate new ideas. Mind mapping is a diagrammatic method used to visually organize information. 
Motivation. Motivation is providing a reason for someone to act. Teams can be motivated by 
empowering them to participate in decision-making and encouraging them to work independently. 
• 
Motivation models. People perform better when they are motivated, and people are 
motivated by different things. Understanding what motivates project team members 
and other stakeholders helps to tailor rewards to the individual, thereby eliciting more 
effective engagement. There are a significant number of models that illustrate how people 
are motivated. Four models are described, though these are a small representation of 
available models. 
◾ 
Hygiene and motivational factors. Frederick Herzberg conducted a study of motivational 
factors in working life. He believed that job satisfaction and dissatisfaction stem from 
conditions called motivational factors. Motivational factors include matters that relate 
to the content of the work, such as achievement, growth, and advancement. Insufficient 
motivational factors lead to dissatisfaction. Sufficient motivational factors lead to 
satisfaction. Herzberg also identified hygiene factors related to the work, such as company 
policies, salary, and the physical environment. If hygiene factors are insufficient, they cause 
dissatisfaction. However, even if they are sufficient, they do not lead to satisfaction.

◾ 
Intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation. Daniel Pink published several books about the 
intrinsic factors that motivate people. He stated that while extrinsic rewards, such as 
salary, are motivators to a certain extent, once a person is paid fairly for their work, 
the motivational power of extrinsic rewards ceases to exist. For complicated and 
challenging work, such as much of the work on projects, intrinsic motivators are far 
longer lasting and more effective. Pink identifies three types of intrinsic motivators: 
autonomy, mastery, and purpose: 
▶ 
Autonomy. Autonomy is the desire to direct one’s own life. This desire is aligned 
with being able to determine how, where, and when to accomplish work. Autonomy 
includes flexible work hours, working from home, and work on self-selecting and 
self-managing project teams. 
▶ 
Mastery. Mastery is about being able to improve and excel. The desire to do 
excellent work, learn, and achieve goals are aspects of mastery. 
▶ 
Purpose. Purpose speaks to the need to make a difference. Knowing the project 
vision and how work contributes to achieving that vision allows people to feel like 
they are making a difference. 
◾ 
Theory of needs. David McClelland’s model states that all people are driven by needs 
of achievement, power, and affiliation. The relative strength of each need depends on 
an individual’s experiences and culture. 
▶ 
Achievement. People who are motivated by achievement, such as reaching a goal, 
are motivated by activities and work that is challenging but reasonable. 
▶ 
Power. People who are motivated by power like to organize, motivate, and lead 
others. They are motivated by increased responsibility. 
▶ 
Affiliation. People who are motivated by affiliation seek acceptance and belonging. 
They are motivated by being part of a team. 
◾ 
Theory X, Theory Y, and Theory Z. Douglas McGregor devised the Theory X 
and Theory Y models, which represent a spectrum of employee motivation and 
corresponding management styles. This spectrum was later expanded to include 
Theory Z. 
▶ 
Theory X. The X side of the spectrum assumes individuals work for the sole 
purpose of income. They are not ambitious or goal oriented. The corresponding 
management style to motivate these individuals is a hands-on and top-down 
approach. This management style is often seen in a production or labor-intensive 
environment, or one with many layers of management. 
▶ 
Theory Y. The Y side of the spectrum assumes that individuals are intrinsically 
motivated to do good work. The corresponding management style has a more 
personal, coaching feel. The manager encourages creativity and discussion. This 
management style is often seen in creative and knowledge worker environments. 
▶ 
Theory Z. Abraham Maslow saw Theory Z as a transcendent dimension to work where 
individuals are motivated by self-realization, values, and a higher calling. The optimal 
management style in this situation is one that cultivates insight and meaning. William 
Ouchi’s version of Theory Z focuses on motivating employees by creating a job for 
life, where the focus is on the well-being of employees and their families. This style of 
management seeks to promote high productivity, morale, and satisfaction.

Multicriteria decision analysis. Multicriteria decision analysis is a technique that utilizes a decision 
matrix to provide a systematic analytical approach for establishing criteria, such as risk levels, 
uncertainty, and valuation, to evaluate and rank many ideas. Multicriteria decision analysis tools (e.g., 
prioritization matrix or analytic hierarchy process [AHP] software) can be used to identify the key 
issues and suitable alternatives to be prioritized as a set of decisions for implementation. Criteria are 
prioritized and weighted before being applied to all available alternatives to obtain a mathematical 
score for each alternative. The alternatives are then ranked by score. 
Multipoint estimating. Multipoint estimating is a method used to estimate cost or duration by 
applying an average or weighted average of optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimates when 
there is uncertainty with the individual activity estimates. The accuracy of single-point duration 
estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk. Using multipoint 
estimates helps define an approximate range for an activity’s duration: 
• 
Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources 
likely to be assigned, their productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, 
dependencies on other participants, and interruptions. 
• 
Optimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the best-case scenario for the 
activity. 
• 
Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worst-case scenario for the activity. 
Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the estimates, the expected 
duration, tE, can be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution: 
tE = (tO + tM + tP) / 3 
Triangular distribution is used when there is insufficient historical data or when using judgmental 
data. Duration estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected 
duration and clarify the range of uncertainty around the expected duration. 
Negotiation. Negotiation is a discussion aimed at reaching an agreement. Negotiation is used to 
achieve support or agreement that supports the work of the project or its outcomes and to resolve 
conflicts within the team or with other stakeholders. Negotiation among team members is used to 
reach consensus on project needs. Negotiation can build trust and harmony among team members. 
Procurement negotiation clarifies the structure, rights, and obligations of the parties and other 
terms of the purchases so that mutual agreement can be reached prior to signing a contract. Final 
document language reflects all agreements reached. Negotiation concludes with a signed contract 
document or other formal agreement that can be executed by both buyer and seller. 
The negotiation should be led by a member of the procurement team who has the authority to 
sign contracts. The project manager and other members of the project management team may be 
present during negotiation to provide assistance as needed. 
Networking. Networking is the establishment of connections and relationships with other people 
from the same or other organizations for the purpose of exchanging information and developing 
contacts. Networks provide project managers and their teams with access to informal organizations 
to solve problems, influence actions of their stakeholders, and increase stakeholder support for the 
work and outcomes of the project, thus improving performance.

Nominal group. The nominal group technique is a structured method used to facilitate group 
decision-making by gathering input from participants in a systematic manner. The technique was 
developed to address the challenges of chaotic and unproductive discussions, particularly in large 
groups dealing with controversial topics. This technique aims to equalize participation and minimize 
the dominance of more vocal members, ensuring that all ideas are considered before any discussion 
takes place. 
Nonverbal communication. Examples of nonverbal communication include appropriate body 
language to transmit meaning through gestures, tone of voice, and facial expressions. Mirroring and 
eye contact are also important techniques. The team members should be aware of how they are 
expressing themselves, both through what they say and what they do not say. 
Observation/conversation. Observation and conversation provide a direct way of viewing 
individuals in their environment to see how they perform their jobs or tasks and carry out 
processes. Observation and conversation are particularly helpful for detailed processes when 
the people who use the product have difficulty or are reluctant to articulate their requirements. 
Observation is also known as “job shadowing.” The observation is usually done externally by 
an observer viewing a business expert performing a job. The observation can also be done by 
a “participant observer” who performs a process or procedure to experience how it is done to 
uncover hidden requirements. 
Organizational cultural intelligence. Organizational cultural intelligence is the capability of 
the enterprise to perform effectively in culturally diverse, complex situations and a multicultural 
world. For example, project managers and teams with high organizational cultural intelligence may 
demonstrate strong cultural skills and recognize that different team members from different cultural 
regions can think and express themselves differently. However, at the same time, these project 
managers and teams avoid demonstrating careless cultural stereotyping. 
Organizational theory. Organizational theory provides information regarding the way in which 
people, teams, and organizational units behave. Effective use of common techniques identified in 
organizational theory can shorten the amount of time, cost, and effort needed to create the Plan 
Resource Management process outputs and improve planning efficiency. Applicable organizational 
theories may recommend exercising a flexible leadership style that adapts to the changes in a team’s 
maturity level throughout the project life cycle. It is important to recognize that the organization’s 
structure and culture impact the project’s organizational structure. 
Parametric estimating. Parametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm 
is used to calculate cost or duration based on historical data and project parameters. Parametric 
estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical data and other variables (e.g., square 
footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost, budget, and 
duration. 
Durations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed 
by the number of labor hours per unit of work. For example, duration on a design project is 
estimated by the number of drawings multiplied by the number of labor hours per drawing, or on 
a cable installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the number of labor hours per meter. If the 
assigned resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable per hour, the duration required to 
install 1,000 meters is 40 hours (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour).

This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying 
data built into the model. Parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to 
segments of a project, in conjunction with other estimating methods. 
Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze actual performance of 
work in progress on the project against the schedule baseline, such as actual start and finish dates, 
percent complete, and remaining duration for work in progress. 
Political awareness. Political awareness helps project managers to plan communications based 
on the project environment as well as their organization’s political environment. Political awareness 
concerns the recognition of formal and informal power relationships and the willingness to operate 
within these structures. Aspects of political awareness include the following: 
• 
Understanding the strategies of the organization, 
• 
Knowing who wields power and influence in this arena, and 
• 
Developing an ability to communicate with these stakeholders. 
Preassignment. When physical or team resources for a project are determined in advance, they 
are considered preassigned. This situation can occur if the project is the result of specific resources 
being identified as part of a competitive proposal or if the project is dependent upon the expertise 
of particular persons. Preassignment might also include the team members who have already been 
assigned in Initiating or in other processes before the initial resource management plan has been 
completed. 
Precedence diagramming method. Precedence diagramming method is a technique used for 
constructing a schedule model in which activities are represented by nodes and are graphically linked 
by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in which the activities are to be performed. 
Precedence diagramming method includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. 
A predecessor activity is an activity that logically comes before a dependent activity in a schedule. 
A successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes after another activity in a schedule. 
These relationships are as follows and are illustrated in Figure 5-13: 
• 
Finish-to-start (FS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until 
a predecessor activity has finished. For example, installing the operating system on a PC 
(successor) cannot start until the PC hardware is assembled (predecessor). 
• 
Finish-to-finish (FF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until 
a predecessor activity has finished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is 
required to finish before editing the document (successor) can finish. 
• 
Start-to-start (SS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a 
predecessor activity has started. For example, leveling concrete (successor) cannot begin 
until pouring the foundation (predecessor) begins. 
• 
Start-to-finish (SF). A logical relationship in which a predecessor activity cannot finish until 
a successor activity has started. For example, a new accounts payable system (successor) 
has to start before the old accounts payable system can be shut down (predecessor).

In the precedence diagramming method, FS is the most commonly used type of precedence 
relationship. The SF relationship is very rarely used, but it is included here to present a complete list 
of the relationship types in the precedence diagramming method. 
Two activities can have two logical relationships at the same time (for example, SS and FF). Multiple 
relationships among the same activities are not recommended, so a decision has to be made to 
select the relationship with the highest impact. Closed loops are also not recommended in logical 
relationships. 
Predictive analytics. Predictive analytics uses machine learning and current and historical data to 
discover patterns and to predict and forecast future scenarios, performance, trends, or events. For 
example, predictive analytics can be used when predicting project risks and suggesting effective 
mitigation strategies based on historical data. 
Presentations. A presentation is the formal delivery of information and/or documentation. Clear and 
effective presentations of project information to relevant stakeholders can include but are not limited 
to the following: 
• 
Progress reports and information updates to stakeholders; 
• 
Background information to support decision-making; 
• 
General information about the project and its objectives, for the purposes of raising the 
profile of the work of the project and the team; and

• 
Specific information aimed at increasing understanding and support of the work and 
objectives of the project. 
Presentations are successful when the content and delivery take the following into account: 
• 
Expectations and needs of the audience, and 
• 
Needs and objectives of the project and project team. 
Prioritization/ranking. Stakeholder requirements should be prioritized and ranked, as should the 
stakeholders themselves. Stakeholders with the most interest and the highest influence are often 
prioritized at the top of the list. Commonly used methods include MoSCoW (must have, should have, 
could have, and will not have), 100-point method, cost of delay, and Kano analysis. 
Probability and impact matrix. A probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the 
probability of occurrence of each risk and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. 
Prioritization rules may be specified by the organization in advance of the project and included in 
organizational process assets, or they may be tailored to the specific project. Opportunities and 
threats are represented in a common probability and impact matrix using positive definitions of 
impact for opportunities and negative impact definitions for threats. Descriptive terms (such as very 
high, high, medium, low, and very low) or numeric values can be used for probability and impact. 
Where numeric values are used, these can be multiplied to give a probability–impact score for each 
risk, which allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority level. 
An example probability and impact matrix is presented in Figure 5-14, which also shows a possible 
numeric risk-scoring scheme. 
Problem-solving. Problem-solving entails finding solutions for issues or challenges. Problem-solving 
can include gathering additional information; critical thinking; and creative, quantitative, and/or 
logical approaches. Effective and systematic problem-solving is a fundamental element in quality

assurance and quality improvement. Using a structured problem-solving method can help eliminate 
the problem and develop a long-lasting solution. Problem-solving methods generally include the 
following actions: 
• 
Define the problem, 
• 
Identify the root cause, 
• 
Generate possible solutions, 
• 
Choose the best solution, 
• 
Implement the solution, and 
• 
Verify solution effectiveness. 
Process analysis. Process analysis identifies opportunities for process improvements. The analysis 
also examines problems, constraints, and non-value-added activities that occur during a process. 
Process automations. Process automation, which can also include robotic process automation 
(RPA), helps speed up business processes. Process automation can reduce manual project work 
and costs, enhance project team and customer experiences by configuring computer software, or 
be a software robot that performs tasks by mimicking a human. Process automation can be used 
for project team meeting scheduling, sending reminders, or other manual project tasks that take a 
sufficient number of hours and can be described as a set of rules or instructions. 
Process improvement. Process improvement refers to the systematic approach of enhancing the 
efficiency and effectiveness of a process within an organization. This approach involves analyzing 
current processes, identifying areas for improvement, and implementing changes to achieve better 
performance, quality, and customer satisfaction. The ultimate goal of process improvement is to 
optimize operations, reduce waste, and increase value for both the organization and its customers. 
Product analysis. Product analysis can be used to define products and services. This analysis 
includes asking questions about a product or service and forming answers to describe the use, 
characteristics, and other relevant aspects of what is going to be manufactured or delivered. 
Each application area has one or more generally accepted methods for translating high-level product 
or service descriptions into meaningful deliverables. Requirements are captured at a high level and 
decomposed to the level of detail needed to design the final product. Examples of product analysis 
techniques include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
Product breakdown, 
• 
Requirements analysis, 
• 
Systems analysis, 
• 
Systems engineering, 
• 
Value analysis, and

managers and teams capture, organize, and communicate essential project information in a clear 
and concise manner. The project canvas typically includes various sections that cover different 
aspects of the project such as objectives, stakeholders, deliverables, resources, risks, and 
timelines. 
The project canvas offers a visual representation of the project, making it easier to understand and 
communicate the project’s scope and key components. By presenting information visually, the project 
canvas allows team members and stakeholders to quickly grasp the overall picture and see how 
different elements of the project interconnect. This visual approach is particularly useful in complex 
projects where multiple factors should be considered simultaneously. 
One of the main advantages of a project canvas is that it provides a comprehensive overview of 
the project. The project canvas includes sections for project objectives, stakeholders, deliverables, 
resources, risks, and timelines, ensuring that all critical aspects of the project are captured in one 
place. This holistic view helps project managers to identify potential gaps or issues early on and to 
plan more effectively. 
The project canvas also serves as a powerful collaboration tool. By providing a common platform for 
discussing and aligning on project details, it facilitates communication and collaboration among team 
members and stakeholders. This collaborative approach helps ensure that everyone involved in the 
project has a shared understanding of its goals, scope, and key components, which can lead to better 
decision-making and more successful project outcomes.

Project dashboards. A project dashboard is a set of charts and graphs showing progress or 
performance against important measures of the project. A common way of showing large quantities 
of information on metrics is a dashboard. Dashboards generally collect information electronically and 
generate charts that depict status. Often, dashboards offer high-level summaries of data and allow 
drill-down analysis into contributing data. Figure 5-16 and Figure 5-17 each provide examples of a 
dashboard. 
Dashboards often include information displayed as stoplight charts (also known as red–amber–green 
[RAG] charts), bar charts, pie charts, and control charts. A text explanation can be used for any 
measures that are outside the established thresholds.

Project management information system (PMIS). A PMIS is an information system consisting 
of the tools and techniques used to gather, integrate, and disseminate the outputs of project 
management processes. A PMIS provides access to information technology software tools, such as 
scheduling software tools, work authorization systems, configuration management systems, and 
information collection and distribution systems, as well as interfaces to other online automated 
systems such as organizational knowledge repositories. Automated gathering and reporting on key 
performance indicators (KPIs) can be part of this system. 
Project reporting. Project reporting is the act of collecting and distributing project information. 
Project information is distributed to many groups of stakeholders and should be adapted to provide 
information at an appropriate level, format, and detail for each type of stakeholder. The format 
may range from a simple communication to more elaborate custom reports and presentations. 
Information may be prepared regularly or on an exception basis. 
Prompt lists. A prompt list is a predetermined list of risk categories that might give rise to individual 
project risks and that could also act as sources of overall project risk. The prompt list can be used 
as a framework to aid the project team in idea generation when using risk identification techniques. 
The risk categories in the lowest level of the risk breakdown structure can be used as a prompt list 
for individual project risks. Some common strategic frameworks are more suitable for identifying

sources of overall project risk, for example PESTLE (political, economic, sociocultural, technological, 
legal, environmental), TECOP (technical, environmental, commercial, operational, political), or VUCA 
(volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity). 
Questionnaires and surveys. Questionnaires and surveys are written sets of questions designed to 
quickly accumulate information from a large number of respondents. Questionnaires and/or surveys 
are most appropriate with varied audiences, when a quick turnaround is needed, when respondents 
are geographically dispersed, and where statistical analysis could be appropriate. 
Recognition and rewards. Part of the team development process involves recognizing and 
rewarding desirable behavior. The original plan for rewarding people is developed during the Plan 
Resource Management process. Cultural differences influence how recognition and rewards are best 
delivered, and understanding these differences helps ensure that the rewards program is meaningful 
and motivating for everyone. Tailoring recognition to align with cultural preferences increases the 
effectiveness of reward systems and enhances employee satisfaction. 
People are motivated when they feel they are valued in the organization, and this value is 
demonstrated by the rewards given to them. Generally, money is viewed as a tangible aspect of any 
reward system, but intangible rewards could be equally or even more effective. Most project team 
members are motivated by an opportunity to grow, accomplish, be appreciated, and apply their 
professional skills to meet new challenges. A good strategy for project managers is to give the team 
recognition throughout the project life cycle rather than waiting until the project is complete. 
Regression analysis. Regression analysis is an analytical method where a series of input 
variables are examined in relation to their corresponding output results in order to develop a 
mathematical or statistical relationship. This technique analyzes the interrelationships between 
different project variables that contributed to project outcomes in order to improve performance 
on future projects. 
Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is a method used to evaluate the amount of risk on the project 
and the amount of schedule and budget reserve to determine whether the reserve is sufficient for 
the remaining risk. Reserve analysis is used as an analytical technique to determine the essential 
features and relationships of components in the project management plan in order to establish a 
reserve for the schedule duration, budget, estimated cost, or funds for a project. 
Cost estimates may include contingency reserves (sometimes called contingency allowances) to 
account for cost uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the budget within the cost baseline that 
is allocated for identified risks. Contingency reserves are often viewed as the part of the budget 
intended to address the known-unknowns that can affect a project. For example, rework for some 
project deliverables could be anticipated, while the amount of this rework is unknown. Contingency 
reserves may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework. Contingency reserves can 
be provided at any level from the specific activity to the entire project. The contingency reserve may 
be a percentage of the estimated cost, a fixed number, or may be developed by using quantitative 
analysis methods. As more precise information about the project becomes available, the contingency 
reserve may be used, reduced, or eliminated. Contingency should be clearly identified in the 
cost documentation. Contingency reserves are part of the cost baseline and the overall funding 
requirements for the project. 
Resource leveling. See resource optimization technique.

Resource optimization technique. The resource optimization technique is a technique in which 
activity start and finish dates are adjusted to balance demand for resources with the available supply. 
Examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust the schedule model due to 
the demand and supply of resources include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
Resource leveling. A resource optimization technique in which adjustments are made 
to the project schedule to optimize the allocation of resources and which may affect the 
critical path. The resource leveling technique adjusts the start and finish dates based on 
resource constraints with the goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available 
supply. Resource leveling can be used when shared or critically required resources are 
available only at certain times or in limited quantities, are overallocated, such as when 
a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period (as 
shown in Figure 5-18), or when there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level.

Available float is used for leveling resources. Consequently, the critical path through the 
project schedule may change. 
• 
Resource smoothing. A resource optimization technique in which free and total float are 
used without affecting the critical path. Resource smoothing is a technique that adjusts 
the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements for resources on the project 
do not exceed certain predefined resource limits. In resource smoothing, as opposed to 
resource leveling, the project’s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not 
be delayed. In other words, activities may only be delayed within their free and total float. 
Resource smoothing may not be able to optimize all resources. 
Resource-based view. Resource-based view is a managerial framework for identifying strategic 
resources that can provide an enterprise with a competitive advantage against its competitors. 
The resource-based view emphasizes evaluating the organizational internal assets, capabilities, 
and competencies to achieve superior competitive performance or project deliverables. Enterprise 
strengths and weaknesses of resources and capabilities and their competitive advantage can be 
evaluated using a framework like VRIO. VRIO stands for value, rarity, imitability, and organization: 
• 
Value can include both tangible and intangible resources and capabilities. 
• 
Rarity means that resources and capabilities are not available to other enterprises. 
• 
Imitability is the extent to which resources and capabilities are difficult to imitate. 
• 
Organization means that the enterprise is effectively utilizing its resources and capabilities. 
Responsibility assignment matrix. A responsibility assignment matrix is a grid that shows the 
project resources assigned to each work package. The matrix is used to illustrate the connections 
between work packages, or activities, and project team members. On larger projects, a responsibility 
assignment matrix can be developed at various levels. For example, a high-level matrix can define 
the responsibilities of a project team, group, or unit within each component of the WBS. A lower-level 
matrix can be used within the group to designate roles, responsibilities, and levels of authority for 
specific activities. The matrix format shows all activities associated with one person and all people 
associated with one activity. This format also ensures that there is only one person accountable 
for any one task to avoid confusion about who is ultimately in charge or has authority for the work. 
One example of a responsibility assignment matrix is a RACI (responsible, accountable, consulted, 
informed) matrix, shown in Figure 5-19. The sample chart shows the work to be done in the left 
column as activities. The assigned resources can be shown as individuals or groups. The project 
manager can select other options, such as “lead” and “resource” designations, as appropriate for the 
project. A RACI matrix is a useful tool to ensure the clear assignment of roles and responsibilities 
when the team consists of internal and external resources. 
Retrospectives. A retrospective is a regularly occurring workshop in which participants explore their 
work and results in order to improve both the process and product. Retrospectives are a form of a 
lessons learned meeting and are conducted frequently throughout the project (at minimum, at the 
end of each iteration). Retrospectives usually cover process-based questions such as what worked 
well and what did not and what are the project team recommendations for future iterations. The 
term retrospective is usually used within adaptive development approaches but can refer to any 
lessons learned session in any approach. 
This frequent reflection helps ensure that the team can quickly address issues and implement 
improvements, rather than waiting until the end of the project. The entire project team participates in

these meetings, fostering a collaborative environment where everyone can contribute their insights 
and suggestions. The outcomes of retrospectives are actionable, with specific actions identified 
and owners assigned to implement the improvements. This immediate impact allows for quick 
adjustments and continuous enhancement of the project process. 
Risk categorization. Risks to the project can be categorized by sources of risk (e.g., using the 
risk breakdown structure [RBS]); the area of the project affected (e.g., using the work breakdown 
structure [WBS]); or other useful categories (e.g., project phase, project budget, and roles and 
responsibilities) to determine the areas of the project most exposed to the effects of uncertainty. 
Risks can also be categorized by common root causes. Risk categories that may be used for the 
project are defined in the risk management plan. 
Grouping risks into categories can lead to the development of more effective risk responses by 
focusing attention and effort on the areas of highest risk exposure, or by developing generic risk 
responses to address groups of related risks. 
Risk probability and impact assessment. Risk probability assessments consider the likelihood 
that a specific risk will occur. Risk impact assessments consider the potential effect on one or 
more project objectives such as schedule, cost, quality, or performance. Impacts will be negative 
for threats and positive for opportunities. Probability and impact are assessed for each identified 
individual project risk. Risks can be assessed in interviews or meetings with participants selected 
for their familiarity with the types of risk recorded in the risk register. Project team members and 
knowledgeable persons external to the project are included. The level of probability for each risk 
and its impact on each objective are evaluated during the interview or meeting. Differences in the 
levels of probability and impact perceived by stakeholders are to be expected, and such differences 
should be explored. Explanatory detail, including assumptions justifying the levels assigned, are 
also recorded. Risk probabilities and impacts are assessed using the definitions given in the risk 
management plan. Risks with low probability and impact may be included within the risk register as 
part of a watch list for future monitoring.

Rolling wave planning. Rolling wave planning is an iterative planning technique in which the work 
to be accomplished in the near term is planned in detail, while the work in the future is planned at a 
higher level. This progressive elaboration allows work to exist at various levels of detail, depending 
on the project life cycle stage. During early strategic planning, when information is less defined, work 
packages are outlined at a high level. As more information becomes available, these packages are 
decomposed into detailed activities. 
Root cause analysis. Root cause analysis is an analytical method used to determine the basic 
underlying reason that causes a variance, defect, or risk. A root cause may underlie more than one 
variance, defect, or risk. Root cause analysis may also be used as a technique for identifying the root 
causes of a problem and solving them. When all root causes for a problem are removed, the problem 
does not recur. 
Schedule compression. Schedule compression is a technique used to shorten the schedule duration 
without reducing the project scope. Schedule compression techniques are used to meet schedule 
constraints, imposed dates, or other schedule objectives. A helpful technique is the negative float 
analysis. The critical path is the one with the least float. Due to violating a constraint or imposed date, 
the total float can become negative. Schedule compression techniques are compared in Figure 5-20 
and include: 
• 
Crashing. A schedule compression technique used to shorten the schedule duration for 
the least incremental cost by adding resources. Examples of crashing include approving 
overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite delivery to activities on

the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional 
resources will shorten the activity’s duration. Crashing does not always produce a viable 
alternative and may result in increased risk and/or cost. 
• 
Fast tracking. A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally 
done in sequence are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. 
An example is constructing the foundation of a building before completing all of the 
architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and increased risk. Fast tracking 
only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical 
path. Such overlapping requires increased coordination efforts between the activities 
concerned, potentially resulting in greater quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase 
project costs. 
Schedule network analysis. Schedule network analysis is a technique used to identify early and late 
start dates, as well as early and late finish dates, for the uncompleted portions of project activities. 
Schedule network analysis is the overarching technique used to generate the project schedule 
model. The analysis employs several other techniques such as critical path method, resource 
optimization techniques, and modeling techniques. Additional analysis includes but is not limited to 
the following: 
• 
Assessing the need to aggregate schedule reserves to reduce the probability of a schedule 
slip when multiple paths converge at a single point in time, or when multiple paths diverge 
from a single point in time, to reduce the probability of a schedule slip. 
• 
Reviewing the network to see if the critical path has high-risk activities or long-lead items 
that would necessitate use of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses to 
reduce the risk on the critical path. 
Schedule network analysis is an iterative process that is employed until a viable schedule model is 
developed. 
Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other 
sources of uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes. The analysis correlates 
variations in project outcomes with variations in elements of the quantitative risk analysis model. 
One typical display of sensitivity analysis is the tornado diagram, which presents the calculated 
correlation coefficient for each element of the quantitative risk analysis model that can influence 
the project outcome. This analysis can include individual project risks, project activities with high 
degrees of variability, or specific sources of ambiguity. Items are ordered by descending strength 
of correlation, giving the typical tornado appearance. An example tornado diagram is shown in 
Figure 5-21. 
Servant leadership. Servant leadership is the practice of leading the team by focusing on 
understanding and addressing the needs and development of team members in order to enable 
the highest possible team performance. Servant leadership is performed in service to the project’s 
business/mission objective(s). 
Simulation. Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources 
of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. The most common 
simulation technique is Monte Carlo analysis, in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are 
used to calculate possible schedule outcomes for the total project. Simulation involves calculating 
multiple work package durations with different sets of activity assumptions, constraints, risks, issues,

or scenarios using probability distributions and other representations of uncertainty. Figure 5-22 
shows a probability distribution for a project with the probability of achieving a certain target date 
(i.e., project finish date). In this example, there is a 10% probability that the project will finish on or 
before the target date of 13 May 2027, while there is a 90% probability of completing the project by 
28 May 2027.

Sprint review. A sprint review is a collaborative review session where the team demonstrates the 
work that was completed during the sprint to stakeholders and solicits their feedback. A sprint 
review or iteration review is held at the end of a sprint or iteration to demonstrate the work that was 
accomplished during the sprint or iteration. 
Stakeholder analysis. Stakeholder analysis results in a list of stakeholders and relevant information 
such as their positions in the organization, roles on the project, “stakes,” expectations, attitudes (their 
levels of support for the project), and their interest in information about the project. Stakeholders’ 
stakes may include but are not limited to a combination of the following: 
• 
Interest. A person or group can be affected by a decision related to the project or its 
outcomes. 
• 
Rights (legal or moral rights). Legal rights, such as occupational health and safety, may 
be defined in the legislation framework of a country. Moral rights may involve concepts of 
protection of historical sites or environmental sustainability. 
• 
Ownership. Ownership is when a person or group has a legal title to an asset or a property.

• 
Knowledge. The person may have specialist knowledge, which can benefit the project 
through more effective delivery of project objectives, organizational outcomes, or 
knowledge of the power structures of the organization. 
• 
Contribution. The person may provide funds or other resources, including human 
resources, or offer support for the project in more intangible ways, such as advocacy in the 
form of promoting the objectives of the project or acting as a buffer between the project 
and the power structures of the organization and its politics. 
Stakeholder engagement assessment matrix. A stakeholder engagement assessment matrix is a 
matrix that compares current and desired stakeholder engagement levels. One way to classify the 
engagement level of stakeholders is shown in Figure 5-23. The engagement level of stakeholders can 
be classified as follows: 
• 
Unaware. The stakeholder is unaware of the project and its potential impacts. 
• 
Resistant. The stakeholder is aware of the project and potential impacts but resistant 
to any changes that may occur as a result of the work or outcomes of the project. These 
stakeholders will be unsupportive of the work or outcomes of the project. 
• 
Neutral. The stakeholder is aware of the project but neither supportive nor unsupportive. 
• 
Supportive. The stakeholder is aware of the project and its potential impacts and 
supportive of the work and its outcomes. 
• 
Leading. The stakeholder is aware of the project and its potential impacts and actively 
engaged in ensuring that the project is a success. 
In Figure 5-23, C represents the current engagement level of each stakeholder and D indicates the 
level that the project team has assessed as essential to ensure project success (desired). The gap 
between current and desired for each stakeholder will direct the level of communications necessary 
to effectively engage the stakeholder. The closing of this gap between current and desired is an 
essential element of monitoring stakeholder engagement. 
Stakeholder mapping/representation. Stakeholder mapping and representation is a method 
of categorizing stakeholders using various methods. Categorizing stakeholders assists the team 
in building relationships with the identified project stakeholders. Common methods include the 
following: 
Figure 5-23. Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix

of the project (influence), or ability to cause changes to the project’s planning or execution. 
These classification models are useful for small projects or projects with simple relationships 
between stakeholders and the project, or within the stakeholder community itself. 
• 
Stakeholder cube. This is a refinement of the grid models previously explained. This model 
combines the grid elements into a three-dimensional model that can be useful to project 
managers and teams in identifying and engaging their stakeholder community. It provides a 
model with multiple dimensions that improves the depiction of the stakeholder community 
as a multidimensional entity and 
 
assists with the development of communication strategies. 
• 
Salience model. The salience model describes classes of stakeholders based on 
assessments of their power (level of authority or ability to influence the outcomes of the 
project), urgency (need for immediate attention, either time-constrained or relating to the 
stakeholders’ high stakes in the outcome), and legitimacy (their involvement is appropriate). 
There is an adaptation of the salience model that substitutes proximity (stakeholders’ direct 
involvement in the project activities, such as their physical proximity to the worksite, or 
their direct contribution to project deliverables) for legitimacy (applying to the team and 
measuring their level of involvement with the work of the project). The salience model 
is useful for large, complex communities of stakeholders or where there are complex 
networks of relationships within the community. It is also useful in determining the relative 
importance of the identified stakeholders. 
• 
Directions of influence. This technique classifies stakeholders according to their influence 
on the work of the project or the project team itself. Stakeholders can be classified in the 
following ways: 
◾ 
Upward (senior management of the performing organization or customer organization, 
sponsor, and steering committee); 
◾ 
Downward (the team or specialists contributing knowledge or skills in a temporary 
capacity); 
◾ 
Outward (stakeholder groups and their representatives outside the project team, such 
as suppliers, government departments, the public, end users, and regulators); or 
◾ 
Sideward (the peers of the project manager, such as other project managers or middle 
managers who are in competition for scarce project resources or who collaborate with 
the project manager in sharing resources or information). 
• 
Prioritization. Prioritizing stakeholders may be necessary for projects with a large number 
of stakeholders, where the membership of the stakeholder community is changing 
frequently, or when the relationships between stakeholders and the project team or within 
the stakeholder community are complex. 
Storytelling. Storytelling in project management is a powerful tool for conveying lessons learned, 
good practices, and project outcomes through narratives. Unlike traditional reports or data 
presentations, storytelling engages the audience by making the information more relatable and 
memorable. 
Stories are particularly effective for transferring tacit knowledge, which is often difficult to articulate 
through formal documentation. By illustrating real-life scenarios and solutions, storytelling helps 
team members understand complex concepts and apply them in their work. Additionally, storytelling 
can shape organizational culture by highlighting values, successes, and learning moments, thereby 
reinforcing desired behaviors and practices.

Effective storytelling enhances communication within the team and across the organization. 
Storytelling makes complex information more understandable and relatable, which can lead to 
better decision-making and problem-solving. Moreover, sharing success stories and overcoming 
challenges can inspire and motivate team members, fostering a positive and collaborative work 
environment. 
Strategies for opportunities. There are five alternative strategies that may be considered for 
dealing with opportunities, as follows: 
• 
Escalate. The escalate risk response strategy is appropriate when the project team or 
project sponsor agrees that an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the 
proposed response would exceed the project manager’s authority. Escalated opportunities 
are managed at the portfolio level, program level, or other relevant part of the organization, 
but not at the project level. The project manager determines who should be notified about 
the opportunity and communicates the details to that person or part of the organization. 
It is important that ownership of escalated opportunities is accepted by the relevant party 
in the organization. Opportunities are usually escalated to the level that matches the 
objectives that would be affected if the opportunity occurred. Escalated opportunities are 
not monitored further by the project team after escalation, although they may be recorded 
in the risk register for information. 
• 
Exploit. The exploit strategy may be selected for high-priority opportunities where the 
organization wants to ensure that the opportunity is realized. This strategy seeks to capture 
the benefit associated with a particular opportunity by ensuring that it definitely happens, 
increasing the probability of occurrence to 100%. Examples of exploiting responses may 
include assigning an organization’s most talented resources to the project to reduce the 
time to completion or using new technologies or technology upgrades to reduce cost and 
duration. 
• 
Share. Sharing involves transferring ownership of an opportunity to a third party so that 
it shares some of the benefit if the opportunity occurs. It is important to select the new 
owner of a shared opportunity carefully, so they are best able to capture the opportunity 
for the benefit of the project. Risk sharing often involves payment of a risk premium to the 
party taking on the opportunity. Examples of sharing actions include forming risk-sharing 
partnerships, teams, special-purpose companies, or joint ventures. 
• 
Enhance. The enhance strategy is used to increase the probability and/or impact of an 
opportunity. Early enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the 
benefit after the opportunity has occurred. The probability of occurrence for an opportunity 
may be increased by focusing attention on its causes. Where it is not possible to increase 
probability, an enhancement response might increase the impact by targeting factors that 
drive the size of the potential benefit. Examples of enhancing opportunities include adding 
more resources to an activity to finish early. 
• 
Accept. Accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is 
taken. This strategy may be appropriate for low-priority opportunities, and it may also be 
adopted where it is not possible or cost-effective to address an opportunity in any other 
way. Acceptance can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance 
strategy is to establish a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or 
resources to take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no 
proactive action apart from periodic review of the opportunity to ensure that it does not 
change significantly.

Strategies for overall project risk. Risk responses should be planned and implemented not only for 
individual project risks but also to address overall project risk. The same risk response strategies that 
are used to deal with individual project risks can also be applied to overall project risk: 
• 
Avoid. Where the level of overall project risk is significantly negative and outside the 
agreed-upon risk thresholds for the project, an avoid strategy may be adopted. This strategy 
involves taking focused action to reduce the negative effect of uncertainty on the project as 
a whole and bring the project back within the thresholds. An example of avoidance at the 
overall project level might include removal of high-risk elements of scope from the project. 
Where it is not possible to bring the project back within the thresholds, the project may be 
canceled. This strategy represents the most extreme degree of risk avoidance, and it should 
be used only if the overall level of threat is, and will remain, unacceptable. 
• 
Exploit. Where the level of overall project risk is significantly positive and outside the 
agreed-upon risk thresholds for the project, an exploit strategy may be adopted. This 
strategy involves taking focused action to capture the positive effect of uncertainty on 
the project as a whole. An example of exploiting at the overall project level might include 
the addition of high-benefit elements of scope to the project to add value or benefits to 
stakeholders. Alternatively, the risk thresholds for the project may be modified with the 
agreement of key stakeholders in order to embrace the opportunity. 
• 
Transfer/share. If the level of overall project risk is high but the organization is unable 
to address it effectively, a third party may be involved to manage the risk on behalf of the 
organization. Where overall project risk is negative, a transfer strategy is required, which 
may involve payment of a risk premium. In the case of a high positive overall project risk, 
ownership may be shared in order to reap the associated benefits. Examples of both 
transfer and share strategies for overall project risk include but are not limited to setting 
up a collaborative business structure in which the buyer and seller share the overall project 
risk, launching a joint venture or special-purpose company, or subcontracting key elements 
of the project. 
• 
Mitigate/enhance. These strategies involve changing the level of overall project risk to 
optimize the chances of achieving the project’s objectives. The risk mitigation strategy 
is used where overall project risk is negative, and risk enhancement applies when it is 
positive. Examples of mitigation or enhancement strategies include replanning the project, 
changing the scope and boundaries of the project, modifying project priority, changing 
resource allocations, adjusting delivery times, etc. 
• 
Accept. Where no proactive risk response strategy is possible to address overall project 
risk, the organization may choose to continue with the project as currently defined, even 
if overall project risk is outside the agreed-upon thresholds. Risk acceptance can be either 
active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish an overall 
contingency reserve for the project, including amounts of time, money, or resources to be 
used if the project exceeds its thresholds. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action 
apart from periodic review of the level of overall project risk to ensure that it does not 
change significantly. 
Strategies for threats. There are five alternative strategies that may be considered for dealing with 
threats, as follows: 
• 
Escalate. Risk escalation is appropriate when the project team or project sponsor agrees 
that a threat is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would

exceed the project manager’s authority. Escalated risks are managed at the portfolio level, 
program level, or other relevant part of the organization, but not at the project level. The 
project manager determines who should be notified about the threat and communicates 
the details to that person or part of the organization. It is important that the ownership of 
escalated threats is accepted by the relevant party in the organization. Threats are usually 
escalated to the level that matches the objectives that would be affected if the threat 
occurred. Escalated threats are not monitored further by the project team after escalation, 
although they may be recorded in the risk register for information. 
• 
Avoid. Risk avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the 
project from its impact. Avoidance may be appropriate for high-priority threats with a high 
probability of occurrence and a large negative impact. Avoidance may involve changing 
some aspect of the project management plan or changing the objective that is in jeopardy 
in order to eliminate the threat entirely, reducing its probability of occurrence to zero. The 
risk owner may also take action to isolate the project objectives from the risk’s impact if it 
were to occur. Examples of avoidance actions may include removing the cause of a threat, 
extending the schedule, changing the project strategy, or reducing scope. Some risks can 
be avoided by clarifying requirements, obtaining information, improving communication, or 
acquiring expertise. 
• 
Transfer. Risk transference involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to 
manage the risk and to bear the impact if the threat occurs. Risk transfer often involves 
the payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the threat. The risk transfer can be 
achieved by a range of actions, which include but are not limited to the use of insurance, 
performance bonds, warranties, guarantees, etc. Agreements may be used to transfer 
ownership and liability for specified risks to another party. 
• 
Mitigate. In risk mitigation, action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or 
impact of a threat. Early mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the 
damage after the threat has occurred. Adopting less-complex processes, conducting more 
tests, or choosing a more stable seller are examples of mitigation actions. Mitigation may 
involve prototype development to reduce the risk of scaling up from a bench-scale model of a 
process or product. Where it is not possible to reduce probability, a mitigation response might 
reduce the impact by targeting the factors that drive the severity. For example, designing 
redundancy into a system may reduce the impact from a failure of the original component. 
• 
Accept. Risk acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive action is 
taken. This strategy may be appropriate for low-priority threats, and it may also be adopted 
where it is not possible or cost-effective to address a threat in any other way. Acceptance 
can be either active or passive. The most common active acceptance strategy is to establish 
a contingency reserve, including amounts of time, money, or resources to handle the threat 
if it occurs. Passive acceptance involves no proactive action apart from periodic review of 
the threat to ensure that it does not change significantly. 
SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. SWOT analysis is the analysis 
of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of an organization, project, or option. For risk 
identification, it is used to increase the breadth of identified risks by including internally generated 
risks. The technique starts with the identification of strengths and weaknesses of the organization, 
focusing on either the project, organization, or the business area in general. SWOT analysis then 
identifies any opportunities for the project that may arise from strengths, and any threats resulting 
from weaknesses. The analysis also examines the degree to which organizational strengths may 
offset threats and determines if weaknesses might hinder opportunities.

Team building. Team building is conducting activities that enhance the team’s social relationships 
and build a collaborative and cooperative working environment. Team-building activities can vary 
from a 5-minute agenda item in a status review meeting to an off-site, professionally facilitated 
event designed to improve interpersonal relationships. The objective of team-building activities is to 
help individual team members work together effectively. Team-building strategies are particularly 
valuable when team members operate from remote locations without the benefit of face-to-face 
contact. Informal communication and activities can help in building trust and establishing good 
working relationships. While team building is essential during the initial stages of a project, it should 
be a continuous process. Changes in a project environment are inevitable, and to manage them 
effectively, a continuous or renewed team-building effort may be applied. The project manager 
should continually monitor team functionality and performance to determine if any actions are 
needed to prevent or correct various team problems. 
Technical performance analysis. Technical performance analysis compares technical 
accomplishments during project execution to the schedule of technical achievement. The analysis 
requires the definition of objective, quantifiable measures of technical performance, which can be 
used to compare actual results against targets. Such technical performance measures may include 
weight, transaction times, number of delivered defects, storage capacity, etc. Deviation can indicate 
the potential impact of threats or opportunities. 
Test and inspection planning. During the planning phase, the project manager and the project team 
determine how to test or inspect the product, deliverable, or service to meet the stakeholders’ needs 
and expectations, as well as how to meet the goal for the product’s performance and reliability. The 
tests and inspections are industry dependent and can include, for example, alpha and beta tests in 
software projects, strength tests in construction projects, inspection in manufacturing, and field tests 
and nondestructive tests in engineering. 
Testing/product evaluations. Testing is an organized and constructed investigation conducted 
to provide objective information about the quality of the product or service under test in 
accordance with the project requirements. The intent of testing is to find errors, defects, bugs, 
or other nonconformance problems in the product or service. The type, amount, and extent of 
tests needed to evaluate each requirement depend on the nature of the project, time, budget, 
and other constraints. Tests can be performed throughout the project, as different components of 
the project become available, and at the end of the project on the final deliverables. Early testing 
helps identify nonconformance problems and helps reduce the cost of fixing the nonconforming 
components. 
Different application areas require different tests. For example, software testing may include unit 
testing, integration testing, black-box, white-box, interface testing, regression testing, alpha testing, 
etc. In construction projects, testing may include cement strength, concrete workability tests, 
nondestructive tests at construction sites for testing the quality of hardened concrete structures, and 
soil tests. In hardware development, testing may include environmental stress screening, burn-in 
tests, system testing, and more. 
Text-oriented formats. Team member responsibilities that require detailed descriptions can be 
specified in text-oriented formats. Usually in outline form, these documents provide information such 
as responsibilities, authority, competencies, and qualifications. The documents are known by various 
names including position descriptions and role–responsibility–authority forms. These documents can 
be used as templates for future projects, especially when the information is updated throughout the 
current project by applying lessons learned.

Theory of constraints (TOC). Theory of constraints is a body of knowledge focused on improving the 
system-level performance of an organization, end-to-end process, project portfolio, or project. The 
TOC application to a project or project portfolio is critical chain project management (CCPM). See also 
critical chain project management and continuous improvement. 
To-complete performance index (TCPI). The to-complete performance index (TCPI) is a measure 
of the cost performance that should be achieved with the remaining resources in order to meet 
a specified management goal, expressed as the ratio of the cost to finish the outstanding work to 
the remaining budget. The TCPI is the calculated cost performance index that is achieved on the 
remaining work to meet a specified management goal such as the budget at completion (BAC) or 
estimate at completion (EAC). If it becomes obvious that the BAC is no longer viable, the project 
manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Once approved, the EAC may replace the BAC in the 
TCPI calculation. The equation for TCPI is: (BAC − EV) / (BAC − AC) where: BAC = budget at completion, 
EV = earned value, and AC = actual cost. 
The TCPI is conceptually displayed in Figure 5-24. The equation for the TCPI is shown in the lower-
left corner as the work remaining (defined as the BAC minus the EV) divided by the funds remaining 
(which can be either the BAC minus the AC, or the EAC minus the AC). 
If the cumulative CPI falls below the baseline (as shown in Figure 5-24), all future work of the project 
should be performed immediately in the range of the TCPI (BAC) (as reflected in the top line of 
Figure 5-24) to stay within the authorized BAC. Whether this level of performance is achievable is 
a judgment call based on several considerations, including risk, time remaining in the project, and 
technical performance. Such a level of performance is displayed as the TCPI (EAC) line. The equation 
for the TCPI is based on the EAC: (BAC − EV) / (EAC − AC). The EVM formulas are provided in Table 5-1.

Training. Training includes all activities designed to enhance the competencies of the project team 
members. Training can be formal or informal. Examples of training methods include classroom, 
online, computer-based, on-the-job training from another project team member, mentoring, and 
coaching. If project team members lack the necessary management or technical skills, such skills can 
be developed as part of the project work. 
Scheduled training takes place as stated in the resource management plan. Unplanned training takes 
place as a result of observation, conversation, and project performance appraisals conducted during 
management of the project team. Training costs could be included in the project budget or supported 
by the performing organization if the added skills may be useful for future projects. Training may be 
performed by in-house or external trainers. 
Trend analysis. Trend analysis is an analytical method that uses mathematical models to forecast 
future outcomes based on historical results. The analysis looks ahead in the project for expected

slippages and warns the project manager in advance that there may be problems later in the 
schedule if established trends persist. This information is made available early enough in the project 
timeline to give the project team time to analyze and correct any anomalies. The results of trend 
analysis can be used to recommend preventive actions if necessary. 
Tuckman ladder. One of the models used to describe team development is the Tuckman ladder, 
which includes five stages of development that teams may go through. Although it is common for 
these stages to occur in order, it is not uncommon for a team to get stuck in a particular stage or 
regress to an earlier stage. Projects with team members who worked together in the past may also 
skip a stage. 
• 
Forming. This phase is where the team members meet and learn about the project and 
their formal roles and responsibilities. Team members tend to be independent and not as 
open in this phase. 
• 
Storming. During this phase, the team begins to address the project work, technical 
decisions, and the project management approach. If team members are not 
collaborative or open to differing ideas and perspectives, the environment can become 
counterproductive. 
• 
Norming. In this phase, team members begin to work together and adjust their work habits 
and behaviors to support the team. The team members learn to trust one another. 
• 
Performing. Teams that reach the performing stage function as a well-organized unit. They 
are interdependent and work through issues smoothly and effectively. 
• 
Adjourning. In this phase, the team completes the work and moves on from the project. 
This typically occurs when staff is released from the project as deliverables are completed. 
The duration of a particular stage depends upon team dynamics, team size, and team leadership. The 
project management team should have a good understanding of team dynamics to move the team 
members through all stages in an effective manner. 
Value stream mapping. Value stream mapping is a display of the critical steps in a process and 
the time taken in each step to identify waste. Value stream mapping is a Lean technique used to 
document, analyze, and improve the flow of information or materials required to produce a product 
or service for a customer. A value stream begins, ends, and hopefully continues with a customer. 
A value stream is the set of activities that takes place to add value for customers, from the initial 
request through realization of value by the customers. 
Variance analysis. Variance analysis is a technique for determining the cause and degree of 
difference between the baseline and actual performance. The technique uses mathematical 
models to forecast future outcomes based on historical results. Variance analysis reviews the 
differences (or variances) between planned and actual performance. This analysis can include 
duration estimates, cost estimates, resource utilization, resource rates, technical performance, and 
other metrics. Variance analysis reviews the variances from an integrated perspective considering 
cost, time, technical, and resource variances in relation to one another to get an overall view of 
variance on the project. This review allows for the appropriate preventive or corrective actions to be 
initiated. 
Velocity. Velocity is a measure of a team’s productivity rate at which the deliverables are produced, 
validated, and accepted within a predefined interval.

Virtual collaboration tools. Virtual collaboration tools are software applications and platforms 
designed to facilitate communication, coordination, and collaboration among project team members 
who may be geographically dispersed. 
• 
Example: Cloud-based collaboration platforms. Cloud-based collaboration platforms or 
tools allow multiple project team members and other stakeholders to access, review, and 
edit various documents and information in real time as they are stored in the cloud. 
Virtual reality (VR). Virtual reality is a computer modeling and simulation technique that allows 
project team members or other stakeholders to interact within an artificial, three-dimensional 
environment by using headsets, glasses, or other means of technology. 
Virtual teams. Virtual teams are groups of people with a shared goal who fulfill their roles with 
little or no time spent meeting face to face. The use of virtual teams creates new possibilities when 
acquiring project team members. The availability of communication technologies such as email, audio 
conferencing, social media, web-based meetings, and videoconferencing has made virtual teams 
more feasible. The virtual team model makes it possible to do the following: 
• 
Form teams of people from the same organization who live in widespread geographic areas; 
• 
Add special expertise to a project team even though the expert is not in the same 
geographic area; 
• 
Incorporate employees who work from home offices; 
• 
Form teams of people who work different shifts, hours, or days; 
• 
Include people with mobility limitations or disabilities; 
• 
Move forward with projects that would have been held or canceled due to travel expenses; 
and 
• 
Save the expense of offices and the physical equipment needed for employees. 
The use of virtual teams can bring benefits such as the use of more skilled resources, reduced costs, 
less travel and relocation expenses, and the proximity of team members to suppliers, customers, 
or other key stakeholders. Virtual teams can use technology to create an online team environment 
where the team can store files, use conversation threads to discuss issues, and keep a team calendar. 
Communication planning becomes increasingly important in a virtual team environment. Additional 
time may be needed to set clear expectations, facilitate communications, develop protocols for 
resolving conflicts, include people in decision-making, understand cultural differences, and share 
credit in successes. 
Visual controls. In lean environments, information radiators are known as visual controls. Visual 
controls illustrate processes to easily compare actual against expected performance. Visual controls 
show a process using visual cues. Visual controls can be present for all levels of information from 
business value delivered to tasks that have started. They should be highly visible for anyone to see. 
Some examples include the following: 
• 
Task boards. A task board is a visual representation of the planned work that allows 
everyone to see the status of the tasks. A task board can show work that is ready to be started 
(to do), work in progress, and work that is completed (see Figure 5-25). A task board allows 
anyone to see, at a glance, the status of a particular task or the number of tasks in each stage

Kanban Board 
Cycle time is the 
time from when 
a task starts until 
it is completed. 
Deliver to Customer 
Lead time is the time from 
when a task is put on the 
board until it is delivered. 
Because the order of the 
items in the Ready column 
can be changed, this can 
be unpredictable. 
There is a limit 
on this column. 
Tasks can be 
swapped with 
other tasks at 
any time. 
 
Figure 5-25. Task Board or Kanban Board 
of work. Different color sticky notes can represent different types of work, and dots can be 
used to show how many days a task has been in its current position. Flow-based projects, 
such as those that use kanban boards, can use these charts to limit the amount of work in 
progress. If a column is approaching the work-in-progress limit, project team members can 
“swarm” around the current work to help those working on tasks that are slowing the flow. 
•
Burn charts. Burn charts, such as burnup or burndown charts, can show project team
velocity. Velocity measures the productivity rate at which the deliverables are produced,
validated, and accepted within a predefined interval. A burnup chart can track the amount
of work done compared to the expected work that should be done (see Figure 5-26).

Majority. A decision that is reached with support obtained from more than 50% of the 
members of the group. Having a group size with an uneven number of participants can 
ensure that a decision will be reached rather than resulting in a tie.

A burndown chart can show the number of story points remaining or the amount of risk 
exposure that has been reduced. 
• 
Other types of charts. Visual charts can also include information such as an impediment 
list that shows a description of the impediment to getting work done, the severity, and the 
actions being taken to resolve the impediment. 
Voting. Voting is a collective decision-making technique and assessment process having multiple 
alternatives with an expected outcome in the form of future actions. These techniques can be used 
to generate, classify, and prioritize product requirements. Examples of voting techniques include the 
following: 
• 
Unanimity. A decision that is reached whereby everyone agrees on a single course of 
action. 
• 
• 
Plurality. A decision that is reached whereby the largest block in a group decides, even 
if a majority is not achieved. This method is generally used when the number of options 
nominated is more than two.

What-if analysis. What-if analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in order to predict their 
effect (positive or negative) on project objectives. This process is an analysis of the question: “What 
if the situation represented by scenario X happens?” A schedule network analysis is performed using 
the schedule to compute the different scenarios, such as delaying a major component delivery, 
extending specific engineering durations, or introducing external factors such as a strike or a change 
in the permit process. The outcome of the what-if analysis can be used to assess the feasibility of the 
project schedule under different conditions, and in preparing schedule reserves and response plans 
to address the impact of unexpected situations.

Appendix X2 
Project Management Ofces 
X2.1 Introduction 
The concept of the project management office (PMO) has evolved over the last few decades, moving 
from a process-focused entity that standardizes methodologies and tools for project management 
to a customer-oriented partner focused on delivering a value that is perceived by the customers and 
stakeholders within the organization. This transition can be seen as a shift from a process-centric to 
a customer-centric entity. As a result, the centralized activities provided by a PMO, whether related to 
portfolios, programs, or projects, are increasingly tailored to the unique needs and strategic direction 
of the organization. 
In today’s dynamic business environment, the PMO’s role extends beyond merely executing 
projects; it involves aligning its services with strategic goals to maximize impact and relevance. While 
traditional benefits such as cost savings, efficiency gains, and improved stakeholder satisfaction 
remain important, modern PMOs are also expected to drive broader enterprise value. This effort 
includes establishing enterprise-wide good practices, fostering cross-team knowledge sharing, 
strengthening risk management capabilities, and developing project management competencies 
across the organization. By delivering both tangible and intangible benefits through these 
multifaceted contributions, PMOs can elevate their perceived value and ensure a sustainable, long-
term impact on organizational performance. 
X2.2 The PMO Value Proposition 
The core value proposition of the PMO lies in its ability to enable strategic execution, enhance 
delivery performance, and strengthen organizational capabilities across portfolios, programs, and 
projects. A modern PMO does more than oversee processes; it acts as a business partner that helps 
the organization prioritize the right work, deliver it effectively, and continuously improve how value is 
realized. 
This value is twofold: It includes both the actual value delivered, such as cost efficiencies, risk 
reduction, improved decision-making, and accelerated delivery, as well as the value perceived by its 
stakeholders, which is influenced by how well the PMO’s services resonate with organizational needs 
and priorities.

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
While measurable outcomes like cost savings or efficiency gains are important, intangible benefits 
such as improved collaboration, enhanced transparency, and stakeholder confidence also 
significantly contribute to perceived value. Importantly, the perception of value is often shaped by 
the organization’s project management maturity; more mature organizations tend to recognize and 
leverage PMO contributions more fully. 
To sustain relevance, PMOs should ensure that their objectives translate into visible, day-to-day 
contributions that reflect what the business values most. This effort requires not only tracking 
delivery performance, but also continuously aligning PMO activities with evolving business needs, 
and ensuring that the PMO is seen not merely as a support function but as an essential enabler of 
enterprise success. 
X2.3 Importance of Customer Centricity for a PMO 
A customer-centric PMO focuses its services and operations on understanding and responding to 
stakeholder needs, ensuring that the value delivered is not only tangible, but also experienced as 
relevant and meaningful by its customers. In this context, the PMO evolves from a function that 
enforces standardized processes to one that serves as a flexible, responsive partner aligned with 
business outcomes. 
Crucially, the concept of “customer” should be understood in its broadest sense. The PMO serves 
not only senior executives or external clients, but also internal stakeholders such as project 
managers, project teams, and delivery units. These groups rely on the PMO for practical support, 
timely guidance, and tools to help them succeed in delivering value. A truly customer-centric PMO 
recognizes this diversity and adjusts its services accordingly. Communication with customers should 
be tailored toward the customer’s needs and the value that the customer expects, and not only 
the processes and methodologies required to achieve the value. The range of services that will be 
provided is then tailored by the PMO, based on what is needed and valued by the customer. The 
technical aspects—the tools and methodologies—are the means of how to deliver value to satisfy the 
customer’s needs. 
The success of the PMO depends on its ability to define a set of services that can bring added value 
to the customer and that will be positively perceived by the customer over time. The customer’s 
perception and the identification of evolving customer needs are crucial elements of tailoring and 
also help to evolve the PMO over time. As business priorities shift, so should the PMO’s offerings. 
Maintaining this relevance depends on the PMO’s ability to translate strategic intent into operational 
support that resonates with different stakeholder groups. The success of the PMO is measured not 
only by how well it delivers its services, but by how well those services are aligned to the evolving 
context and priorities of the organization. 
X2.4 PMO Type, Model, and Structure 
The selection of a PMO type, model, and structure is a nuanced decision that requires careful 
consideration of the unique characteristics and needs of an organization. The wide range of 
available models can create a dilemma: determining which one is truly the “best” or “right” choice. 
This thinking often leads to the misguided belief that a single model is ideal, making others seem 
obsolete or irrelevant. Such a traditional approach, which seeks a perfect PMO model as a solution 
for organizational challenges, is fundamentally flawed because it encourages the adoption of a 
supposed “ideal” model and, if it fails, waits for the next model. This strategy overlooks a crucial

--- Page 340 ---

aspect of PMOs, which is their inherent uniqueness. 
PMOs are complex entities that defy universal consensus. There are no empirically proven, 
universally ideal, or consistently more effective PMO models. While various models, such as the 
directive PMO, supportive PMO, and agile PMO, offer valuable insights, they should not be viewed 
as mutually exclusive paths. Instead, these models should be seen as a palette of options that can 
be combined to meet specific organizational needs. The literature on PMOs presents a rich array of 
types, each offering unique perspectives on how these entities can function within organizations. 
This diversity reflects the complex and multifaceted nature of PMOs and the varied needs of the 
organizations they serve. 
Recent approaches emphasize greater flexibility, moving away from rigid classifications and 
proposing more adaptable strategies grounded in the unique needs of each organization. While these 
approaches offer valuable insights into structuring and operating PMOs, it is crucial to understand 
that no single type should be seen as a universal solution. Instead, these models should inspire PMO 
professionals to develop tailored solutions that address their organizations’ unique needs. 
The evolution of PMOs highlights the growing understanding that flexibility and customization are 
key to their success. Empirical evidence consistently shows that the most valued PMOs are those that 
have customized structures to fit their unique organizational context, rather than rigidly adhering to 
a single, predefined model. The risk lies in the temptation to seek a “perfect” PMO model or to jump 
from one trendy type to another. Such approaches often lead to misalignment between the PMO and 
the organization’s actual needs, resulting in decreased value perception and effectiveness. Instead 
of rigidly categorizing PMOs or adhering strictly to predefined types, successful PMOs often exhibit a 
blend of characteristics drawn from multiple types. This hybridization allows them to create a unique 
structure that best serves their specific context and stakeholder needs. 
X2.5 PMO Maturity Models 
PMO maturity models are essential tools for organizations aiming to enhance their project 
management capabilities. These models provide a structured framework that allows organizations 
to assess their current PMO maturity level, identify areas for improvement, and develop a roadmap 
for growth. By benchmarking against industry standards, organizations can set realistic goals and 
measure progress over time. This systematic approach not only optimizes project management 
practices but also ensures alignment with strategic objectives, ultimately leading to improved 
organizational performance. 
A customer-centric PMO maturity model emphasizes the importance of aligning PMO services with 
the strategic goals of the organization. In this model, the PMO acts as a service provider, focusing 
on delivering value that meets the specific needs and expectations of its stakeholders. By placing 
the customer at the center, PMOs can tailor their services to maximize impact and relevance. This 
approach helps ensure that PMOs remain agile and responsive to changing business needs, thereby 
enhancing their perceived value within the organization and contributing to overall success. 
The design of a PMO should consider industry-specific profiles and integrate seamlessly with the 
organizational structure. A mature PMO recognizes the unique challenges and requirements of its 
industry, adapting its practices and services accordingly. Additionally, the PMO should align with the 
existing organizational framework, fostering collaboration and communication across departments. 
This integration enables the PMO to leverage organizational resources effectively and promote a

consistent project management approach throughout the enterprise, ensuring that the PMO’s efforts 
are aligned with broader organizational goals. 
The culture and mandate of a mature PMO should reflect and support the organization’s culture, 
values, and strategic priorities. A well-developed PMO aligns its culture with that of the organization, 
facilitating smoother adoption of project management methodologies. Its mandate is to focus 
on delivering measurable value to the organization. By demonstrating a clear link between PMO 
activities and tangible business outcomes, the PMO gains recognition and support from key 
stakeholders. This recognition reinforces the PMO’s role as a strategic asset, driving continuous 
improvement and maturity in project management practices across the organization.

Appendix X3 
Artifcial Intelligence 
X3.1 Artificial Intelligence in the Project Context 
Artificial intelligence (AI) describes a set of technologies that simulate human behavior on computers. 
This technology allows machines to perform tasks they were not directly programmed to do, learn 
from experiences, and adapt to new situations. AI has a broad range of applications, including 
pattern recognition, fraud detection, robotics, and the discovery of new drugs to combat diseases. 
The quick changes in the field of AI, and its rising potential, require great adaptability for staying 
current with new tools and in learning new ways of working. 
Advances in the AI field, such as the development of large language models (LLMs), have expanded its 
applicability while simplifying its adoption, bringing the technology to the mainstream. What was once 
a tool only available to experts or companies with abundant resources is now accessible with minimal 
manual intervention. In that sense, the technology has become so pervasive that every professional, 
including project professionals, should obtain a better understanding of AI to remain productive. 
Though AI’s long-term impacts remain to be seen, it is already creating a major shift in most 
professions, increasing the productivity of the workforce and creating new job opportunities while 
possibly extinguishing others. 
A common classification of AI systems is described as follows and is shown in Figure X3-1: 
• 
Artificial intelligence (AI). AI is a broader term describing systems that can reason, learn, 
and act autonomously. 
• 
Machine learning (ML). ML is a subfield of AI that uses data to train neural network 
models, which can predict outputs based on previous inputs. 
• 
Deep learning (DL). DL is a more advanced ML type that relies on multilayered neural 
networks to extract features and make decisions. Deep learning often requires large data 
sets and significant computational resources. 
• 
Generative AI (GenAI). GenAI is a subset of deep learning that applies large language 
models (LLMs) to create systems capable of generating new data such as text, speech, 
audio, pictures, and videos, among others. 
For the sake of simplification, this appendix refers to the broader term “AI,” even if some of the use 
cases are built using more specific techniques such as GenAI.

X3.1.1 Strategies for AI Adoption 
AI can support project management tasks in many ways. The more complex the task, the more 
human intervention is required to result in high-quality outcomes. In that sense, a good strategy 
is classifying tasks according to complexity and the need for human supervision. As a result of this 
classification, the opportunities to use AI fall into three categories: 
• 
Automation. Tasks that are low complexity and require little human intervention in their 
final output can be automated. Common examples are report generation, document 
analysis, and conference call summarization. Standard prompts can be created and 
reutilized across different projects and teams. A good source of those prompts can be 
found in the PMI Prompt Library as part of the PMI Infinity™ tool. 
• 
Assistance. At the assistance level, the tools complement analysis and iteratively build 
ideas toward an expected output. The result of the first iterations should not be considered 
complete without further analysis and refinement. Some examples are the creation of a risk

register or scheduling plan with buffers. A project professional is expected to review the 
results to ensure they are accurate and complete. 
• 
Augmentation. Augmentation is the enhancement of existing capabilities and the 
exploration of new ones by professionals. Augmentation focuses on strategic and complex 
tasks such as balancing the options of a project portfolio to maximize the return of 
investment or performing risk forecasting based on external variables. Project professionals 
should use the tool as a brainstorming partner, exchanging ideas and refining the results 
through multiple iterations. 
X3.1.2 State of the Market 
There are many AI tools, both free and paid, available for public use. Typically, the free options 
restrict the number of questions (prompts) that can be submitted to the engine in a given interval of 
time. The other big difference is how the engine deals with user data. Paid versions allow the user to 
restrict the use of its data to retrain the models, ensuring privacy and protecting intellectual property. 
X3.2 Common Use Cases 
Table X3-1 demonstrates how AI can significantly enhance various aspects of project management, 
including planning, controlling, stakeholder engagement, risk management, and strategic decision-
making. 
Figure X3-2 presents some use cases classified by complexity and the need for human intervention. 
X3.3 Responsible Use and Ethical Concerns 
The use of AI in projects and organizations brings together associated benefits and risks that should 
be considered. On one hand, the use of AI may shift the daily work of project professionals from 
repetitive tasks to higher-level and more creative tasks. On the other hand, it is up to human beings to 
take the related risks into account and make appropriate decisions regarding AI’s use and potential. 
There are multiple ethical factors and risks that may play a critical role in the adoption of AI, particularly: 
• 
Bias. AI systems can be subject to bias if they are trained with biased data or if the 
algorithms they are using introduce bias themselves. The risk of bias can be mitigated 
through different actions such as: 
◾ 
Diversification of the data sets on which the AI system is trained; 
◾ 
Periodic tests conducted on the AI system, with particular focus on bias; and 
◾ 
Involvement of different teams in the development of the AI system. 
• 
Privacy. AI systems use large data sets that can be sensitive and regulated by privacy 
policies and laws. This use of sensitive information increases the need to properly secure 
the data and ensure that it is collected with a privacy policy in place. There is a risk that the 
data can be used in a way that violates privacy and ethical standards. 
• 
Accountability. AI systems may be responsible for certain decisions, depending on the 
working arrangement. Ultimately, a human should be accountable for each decision, and 
this accountability should be clearly defined.
