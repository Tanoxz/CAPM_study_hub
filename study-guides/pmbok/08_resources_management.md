2.6 Resources Performance Domain 
The Resources performance domain refers to how effectively and efficiently a project team plans 
for and utilizes its available resources. This performance domain encompasses both human 
resources (the project team itself) and physical or virtual resources (equipment, materials, 
supplies, facilities, infrastructure, software, testing environments, licenses, services, information, or 
documents). The Resources performance domain also covers resource availability, utilization, and 
maintenance. 
2.6.1 Key Concepts 
The following key concepts support effective practices in the Resources performance domain. The 
performance domain delves into the key concepts of effectively and efficiently applying the resources 
at the project manager’s disposal. Different skills and competencies are needed to manage team 
resources versus physical or virtual resources. This section explores how to oversee human, physical, 
or virtual resources to foster optimal project outcomes. 
• 
Project manager. The project manager, as a leader of the project team, is responsible 
for team formation and operation as an effective group. Project managers should invest 
suitable effort in acquiring, managing, motivating, and empowering the project team. 
Additionally, project managers should be aware of different aspects that influence the team 
such as team environment, geographical locations of team members, communications 
among stakeholders, organizational change management, internal and external politics, 
cultural issues and organizational uniqueness, and other factors that may alter project 
performance. Proactively developing team skills and competencies while enhancing team 
satisfaction and motivation also falls under a project manager’s responsibility, in addition to 
awareness of professional and ethical behavior. 
• 
Resource manager. The resource manager is an individual with management authority 
over one or more resources. The project team may or may not have direct control over 
resource selection because of collective bargaining agreements, use of subcontractor 
personnel, a matrix environment, internal or external reporting relationships, or other 
reasons. The resources needed for a project can be internal or external to the project-
performing organization. Internal resources are acquired (assigned) from functional or 
resource managers. External resources are obtained through partnerships, joint ventures, 
or procurement processes. For further details, see Appendix X4 on Procurement. 
• 
Human resources (project team members). Human resources consist of individuals 
with assigned roles and responsibilities who work collectively to achieve a shared project 
goal within the project team. The involvement of all team members in project planning 
and decision-making is also beneficial. Project team members add their expertise to the 
process, strengthening their commitment to the project. Typically, project team members 
are guided by the top-down leadership of one or several individuals (see Section 5 on Tools 
and Techniques—centralized management and leadership). Project team members may 
also self-organize, and decision-making may be decentralized (see Section 5 on Tools and 
Techniques—distributed management and leadership). 
• 
Physical, material, or virtual resources. These resources refer to any resource that 
is not a person. These resources may include equipment, materials, supplies, facilities, 
infrastructure, software, testing environments, licenses, services, and anything else 
needed for successful and efficient project completion. Organizations should have

sufficient data on resource demands (now and in the future), resource configurations that 
are required to meet those demands, and the supply of resources. Projects with significant 
physical or virtual resources, such as engineering and construction, may need to plan 
for procurement activities to acquire the resources. These activities may be as simple as 
utilizing a basic ordering agreement or as complicated as managing, coordinating, and 
integrating several large procurement activities. For further details, see Appendix X4 on 
Procurement. 
2.6.2 Processes 
The Resources performance domain includes the processes required to plan, estimate, and acquire 
the resources needed to successfully complete the project, lead the project team, and control 
resources. These processes help ensure that the right resources will be available to the project 
manager and project team at the right time and place. 
The following processes are included in the Resources performance domain (see Figure 2-40): 
• 
Plan Resource Management. The process of defining how to estimate, acquire, lead, and 
utilize physical, virtual, or team resources. 
• 
Estimate Resources. The process of estimating team resources and the type and 
quantities of physical or virtual resources necessary to perform project work. 
• 
Acquire Resources. The process of obtaining the team, physical, or virtual resources 
necessary to complete project work, which is based on the activity list.

resources assigned and allocated to the project are available as planned. This process also 
monitors the planned versus actual use of resources and performs corrective actions as 
necessary. 
2.6.2.1 Plan Resource Management 
The key benefit of this process is that it establishes the approach and level of management effort 
needed to manage project resources based on the type and complexity of the project (see Figure 2-41). 
This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. Resource planning is used 
to determine and identify an approach to ensuring that sufficient resources are available for the 
successful completion of the project. Effective resource planning should consider and plan for the 
availability of—or competition for—scarce resources. 
The specific tools and techniques for the Plan Resource Management process include the 
responsibility assignment matrix, organizational theory, green human resource management, 
resource-based view, and SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis.

2.6.2.2 Estimate Resources 
The key benefit of this process is that it identifies the type, quantity, and characteristics of resources 
required to complete the project. This identification is essential for project managers to plan 
effectively and ensure that all necessary resources are available. Additionally, this process aids in 
anticipating potential resource shortages or surpluses, allowing for proactive adjustments. The 
process also enhances the ability to manage resource allocation and usage risks (see Figure 2-42). 
The Estimate Resources process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The 
process involves detailed analysis and consideration of all aspects of the project to ensure that the 
appropriate resources are allocated efficiently. The Estimate Resources process is closely related to 
the Schedule performance domain (see Section 2.3). 
The specific inputs for the Estimate Resources process are the resource management plan and 
resource calendars. 
2.6.2.3 Acquire Resources 
The key benefit of this process is that it outlines and guides the selection of resources and assigns 
them to their respective activities (see Figure 2-43).

Figure 2-43. Acquire Resources Inputs, Tools and Techniques, and Outputs 
The Acquire Resources process is performed periodically throughout the project as needed. It is 
important that the following factors are considered during the process of obtaining the project 
resources: 
• 
The project manager or project team should collaborate, effectively negotiate, and influence 
others who are able to provide the required team, physical, or virtual resources for the project. 
• 
Failure to acquire the necessary resources for the project may affect the schedule, budget, 
customer satisfaction, and quality while increasing risk. Insufficient resources or capabilities 
decrease the probability of success and, in a worst-case scenario, could result in project 
cancellation. 
• 
If the team, physical, or virtual resources are not available due to constraints such as 
economic factors or assignment to other projects, the project manager or project team 
may be required to assign alternative resources, perhaps with different competencies, 
features, or costs. Alternative resources are allowed if risks are acknowledged and the legal, 
regulatory, mandatory, or other specific criteria are not violated.

• 
These factors and criteria may be considered and addressed during the project planning 
stage. The project manager or team may need to document the impact of the unavailability 
of required resources on the project schedule, budget, risks, quality, training plans, and 
other project management plans. 
2.6.2.4 Lead the Team 
Lead the Team is the process of applying knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques for managing and 
leading the team by improving competencies, team member interactions, and the overall team 
environment to enhance project performance. This process also involves tracking team member 
performance, providing feedback, resolving and escalating issues, and managing team changes to 
optimize project performance. The key benefit of this process is that it influences team behavior, 
manages conflict, and resolves issues among team members (see Figure 2-44). 
The Lead the Team process involves both management and leadership activities as follows: 
• 
Management activities. Management activities focus on the means of meeting project 
objectives such as having effective processes, planning, coordinating, measuring, and 
monitoring work. 
• 
Leadership activities. Leadership activities focus on people and encompass influencing, 
motivating, listening, enabling, and other activities related to leading the project team, all of 
which are important in delivering the intended project outcomes. A project manager should 
be sensitive to the willingness and ability of team members to perform their work and should 
adjust their management and leadership styles to account for these factors as needed. 
2.6.2.4.1 Common Aspects of Team Development 
Regardless of how management activities are structured, the common aspects of project team 
development include the following: 
• 
Vision and objectives. The vision and objectives are communicated throughout the project 
and are essential for understanding. This communication includes referencing the intended 
outcomes when the project team makes decisions and solves problems. 
• 
Roles and responsibilities. Project managers should ensure that project team members 
understand and fulfill their roles and responsibilities. This effort may include identifying 
gaps in knowledge and skills and developing strategies to address those gaps through 
training, mentoring, or coaching. For more information, refer to the responsibility 
assignment matrix information in Section 5, Tools and Techniques. 
• 
Project team operations. Facilitating project team communication, problem-solving, and 
the process of consensus building may include working with the project team to develop a 
project team charter and a set of operating guidelines or project team norms. 
• 
Guidance. Guidance should be directed to the overall project team to keep everyone 
headed in the right direction. Individual project team members may also provide guidance 
on a particular task or deliverable. 
• 
Growth. Identifying areas where the project team is performing well and pointing out areas 
where the project team can improve helps everyone grow. Working collaboratively, the 
project team should identify goals for improvement and take steps to meet those goals. 
Individuals may want to develop their skills and experience in certain areas, and the project 
manager can assist with that.

2.6.2.4.2 High-Performing Project Teams 
The following list is not comprehensive, but identifies some of the factors associated with high-
performing project teams, which is a goal of effective leadership: 
• 
Open communication. An environment that fosters open and safe communication 
allows for productive meetings, problem-solving, brainstorming, understanding, trust, and 
collaboration. 
• 
Shared understanding. Shared understanding can be achieved when the purpose of the 
project and the benefits that it will provide are held in common with the team. Shared 
understanding is closely related to project alignment, which helps ensure that the project’s 
goals and activities are in line with the organization’s mission and strategy. This effort 
involves developing a shared understanding of the project’s purpose and goals—and how 
to achieve them. 
• 
Shared ownership. The more ownership that project team members feel over the 
outcomes, the more likely they are to perform effectively. 
• 
Trust. A project team that is composed of members who trust one another is more willing 
to perform at a higher level to deliver success. People are less likely to do the extra work it 
may take to succeed if they do not trust their project team members, project manager, or 
the organization. 
• 
Collaboration. Project team members who work as a team, rather than working in silos or 
competitively, tend to generate more diverse ideas and deliver better outcomes. 
• 
Adaptability. Project teams that can adapt the way they work to their particular 
environment or situation are more effective. 
• 
Resilience. When issues or failures occur, high-performing project teams recover quickly. 
• 
Empowerment, delegation, and autonomy. Project team members who feel empowered 
to make decisions about the way they work and about specific details in the deliverables 
being produced—even under limited range—perform better and have a higher degree of 
satisfaction than those who are micromanaged. 
• 
Recognition. Project team members who are recognized for the work they put in and the 
performance that they achieve are more likely to continue to perform well. Even the simple 
act of showing appreciation reinforces positive team behaviors. 
The specific tools and techniques of the Lead the Team process are colocation, virtual teams, 
recognition and rewards, training, individual and team assessments, emotional intelligence, 
leadership, distributed management and leadership, centralized management and leadership, 
servant leadership, coaching and mentoring, organizational cultural intelligence, virtual collaboration 
tools, retrospectives, critical thinking, and specific problem-solving methods such as Six Thinking 
Hats®3 (see Section 5 on Tools and Techniques). 
The specific outputs of the Lead the Team process include team performance assessments.

2.6.2.5 Monitor and Control Resourcing 
The Monitor and Control Resourcing process helps ensure that the physical or virtual resources 
assigned and allocated to the project are available as planned. The process also monitors the 
planned versus actual use of physical or virtual resources and performs corrective actions as 
necessary. The key benefit of this process is ensuring that the assigned physical or virtual resources 
are available to the project at the right time and in the right place and are released when no longer 
needed (see Figure 2-45). 
The Monitor and Control Resourcing process should be performed continuously in all project phases 
and throughout the project life cycle. The resources needed for the project should be assigned and 
released at the right time, right place, and in the right amount for the project to continue without 
delays. The Monitor and Control Resourcing process is concerned with physical and virtual resources 
such as equipment, materials, supplies, facilities, infrastructure, software, testing environments, 
licenses, services, or any other relevant resources. Team members are addressed in the Lead the 
Team process. Usually, work performance information is intended for assessing resource usage 
in the project status. However, it is common practice to assess individual performance based on 
work performance information. For assessing team performance, see the Lead the Team process in 
Section 2.6.2.4.

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
 
Updating resource allocations requires knowing what actual resources have been used to date 
and what is still needed. This task is done mainly by reviewing the performance usage to date. The 
Monitor and Control Resourcing process is concerned with: 
• 
Monitoring resource expenditures, 
• 
Identifying and dealing with resource shortages and surpluses in a timely manner, 
• 
Ensuring that resources are used and released according to the plan and project needs, 
• 
Informing appropriate stakeholders if any issues arise with relevant resources, 
• 
Influencing the factors that can create resource utilization changes, and 
• 
Managing the actual changes as they occur. 
The Monitor and Control Resourcing techniques discussed here are those used most frequently on 
projects implementing a predictive approach. There are many others that may be useful on certain 
projects or in some application areas. Failing to manage and control resources efficiently is a risk to 
successful project completion. For example, the following may occur: 
• 
Failing to secure critical equipment or infrastructure on time may result in delays in the 
manufacture of the final product. 
• 
Ordering low-quality materials may damage the quality of the product, causing a high rate 
of recalls or rework. 
• 
Keeping too much inventory may result in high operational costs and reduce the 
organization’s profit. Conversely, an unacceptably low inventory level could hinder the 
ability to satisfy customer demand and, again, reduce the organization’s profit. 
2.6.3 Tailoring Considerations 
Given the uniqueness of each project, activities and processes within the Resources performance 
domain may be tailored to align with the project’s specific requirements, constraints, and stakeholder 
expectations. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
Development approach selection. Leadership styles are tailored to meet the needs of the 
project, environment, and stakeholders. Organizations and project teams with experience 
on a specific type of project may be more self-managing and require less leadership. When 
a project is new to an organization, the tendency is to provide more oversight and use a 
more direct leadership style. 
◾ 
In a predictive development approach, resource management is typically planned and 
structured in advance. Tailoring in this context involves defining resource requirements 
early in the project and allocating them based on the project schedule. This effort 
includes identifying all necessary skills and resources, creating a detailed resource 
management plan, and ensuring resource availability throughout the project. 
◾ 
In an adaptive development approach, projects with high variability benefit from team 
structures that maximize focus and collaboration, such as self-organizing teams with 
generalizing specialists. Collaboration is intended to boost productivity and facilitate 
innovative problem-solving. Collaborative teams may facilitate accelerated integration 
of distinct work activities, improve communication, increase knowledge sharing, and 
provide flexibility of work assignments in addition to other advantages. Although the

--- Page 194 ---

 
 
 
 
benefits of collaboration also apply to other project environments, collaborative teams 
are often critical to the success of projects with a high degree of variability and rapid 
changes because there is less time for centralized tasking and decision-making. 
• 
Maturity of project team culture. When project teams form across different organizations 
based on a contract, strategic partnership, or other business relationship, specific roles 
that perform various functions may be more formalized and less flexible depending on the 
contract or other terms. Such arrangements often require more up-front work to establish 
a “one team” mindset; ensure project team members understand how everyone contributes 
to the project; and establish other enablers that integrate skills, capabilities, and processes. 
The teams may differ in aspects such as: 
◾ 
Unique culture of the project team. Each project team develops its own team culture. 
The project team’s culture may be established deliberately by developing project team 
norms or informally through the behaviors and actions of its project team members. 
The project team culture operates within the organization’s culture but reflects the 
project team’s individual ways of working and interacting. 
◾ 
Transparency on bias. Human beings have a set of biases, some of them unconscious 
and some of them conscious. For example, one person may feel that unless a schedule 
is displayed using a software-generated Gantt chart, it is not a true or valid schedule. 
Another person may have a contrasting bias that detailed planning further out than 30 
days is a waste of time. Being open and transparent about biases up front establishes a 
culture of openness and trust that can enable consensus and collaboration. 
◾ 
Project manager role. The project manager role is key in establishing and maintaining 
a safe, respectful, nonjudgmental environment that allows the project team to 
communicate openly. One way to accomplish this is by modeling desired behaviors, 
such as: 
▶ 
Transparency. Being transparent in how one thinks, makes choices, and processes 
information helps others identify and share their own processes. This openness can 
extend to being transparent about biases as well. 
▶ 
Integrity. Integrity comprises ethical behavior and honesty. Individuals 
demonstrate honesty by sharing risks, communicating their assumptions and 
basis of estimates, delivering bad news early, and ensuring that status reports 
provide an accurate depiction of the project’s progress. Ethical behavior can include 
spotlighting potential defects or negative effects in product design; disclosing 
potential conflicts of interest; ensuring fairness; and making decisions based on 
environmental, stakeholder, and financial impacts. 
▶ 
Respect. Demonstrating respect for each person, how they think, their skills, and 
the perspective and expertise they bring to the project team sets the stage for all 
project team members to adopt this behavior. 
▶ 
Positive discourse. Throughout the project, diverse opinions, different ways of 
approaching situations, and misunderstandings will occur. These are a normal 
part of conducting projects. These challenges present an opportunity to have a 
dialogue rather than a debate. A dialogue entails working with others to resolve 
divergent opinions. The goal is to arrive at a resolution that all parties can embrace. 
Conversely, a debate is a win-lose scenario where people are more interested 
in winning personally than they are in being open to alternative solutions to a 
problem.

environmental influences, and interpersonal interactions. Supporting project team 
members through problem-solving and removing impediments builds a supportive 
culture and leads to a trusting and collaborative environment. Support can also be 
demonstrated by providing encouragement, showing empathy, and engaging in 
active listening. 
▶ 
Courage. Recommending a new approach to a problem or a way of working can 
be intimidating. Likewise, it can be challenging to disagree with a subject matter 
expert or someone with greater authority. However, demonstrating the courage 
that it takes to suggest, disagree, or try something new enables a culture of 
experimentation and communicates to others that it is safe to be courageous and 
try new approaches. 
▶ 
Celebrate success. Focusing on project goals, challenges, and issues often 
sidelines the fact that individual project team members and the project team are 
steadily progressing toward those goals. While work takes priority, project team 
members may neglect to recognize demonstrations of innovation, adaptation, 
service to others, and learning. Instantly recognizing and celebrating successes and 
“quick wins” may offer a sense of accomplishment, keep the team motivated, and 
highlight the continuous progress made toward project goals. 
• 
Industry context. Due to the scarce nature of critical resources, in some industries several 
trends have become popular in the past few years. There is extensive literature about lean 
management, just-in-time manufacturing, Kaizen, total productive maintenance, theory 
of constraints, and other methods. A project manager should determine if the performing 
organization has adopted one or more resource-related methods, tools, and techniques 
and adapted them to the project accordingly. 
• 
Organizational governance structures. Projects operate within a larger organizational 
system. There may be the expectation that the organizational leadership style of top 
management is recognized and reflected in the team’s leadership. The organizational 
structure influences the degree to which authority and accountability are centralized or 
distributed. For further details, see Section 5 on Tools and Techniques, where centralized 
management and leadership and distributed management and leadership are explained. 
• 
Sustainability considerations in decision-making. Projects should consider the 
environmental and social impact of every stage in the value chain, from hiring team members 
to sourcing materials, transportation, and disposal. This effort may involve reducing 
emissions, using renewable energy sources, minimizing waste, and positively affecting local 
communities. For further details, please refer to the Integrate Sustainability Within All Project 
Areas principle in The Standard for Project Management [1]. In addition, Section 5 provides 
further details on tools and techniques such as green human resource management. 
• 
Maturity of the project team members. Project team members who are mature in their 
technical fields may need less oversight and direction than project team members who are 
new to the organization, team, or technical specialty. 
• 
Virtual project teams. A global project workforce is more common today than in the past. 
Despite the best efforts to connect people virtually, it can be challenging to create the 
same level of collaboration and relatedness that is achieved when working face to face. To 
minimize the pitfalls of distributed project teams, technology should be used to increase 
and improve communication.

Emphasis on employee well-being. Employee burnout has been a major concern in 
recent years. Quiet quitting is when employees continually put in the minimum amount 
of effort to keep their jobs but do not go the extra mile for their employer. This lack of 
engagement could mean a reluctance to speak up in meetings or not volunteering for tasks. 
Quiet quitting may also result in greater absenteeism. Companies are prioritizing mental 
health initiatives and creating a work culture that fosters a work-life balance. This effort 
may include flexible work schedules, stress management programs, and generous time-off 
policies. 
2.6.3.1 Examples 
The following are two examples of how these considerations might be applied: 
• 
Example 1. A project team working on a large, high-variability project with an adaptive 
approach may find that resource planning for physical, virtual, or human resources is less 
predictable, requiring flexible agreements and lean methods to control costs and meet 
schedule demands. 
Example 2. A project with a newly formed virtual team may encounter collaboration issues. 
Thus, some suggestions that could be provided include: 
◾ 
• 
Ensuring there are collaboration sites for working together; 
◾ 
Having a project team site to keep all relevant project and project team information 
available; 
◾ 
Using audio, video, and virtual conferencing capabilities for meetings; 
◾ 
Using technology to maintain ongoing contact, such as messaging and texting; 
◾ 
Scheduling time to get to know remote project team members; 
◾ 
Having at least one face-to-face meeting to establish relationships; and 
◾ 
Creating a team charter and defining ways of working. 
2.6.4 Interactions With Other Domains 
The Resources performance domain interacts with all other performance domains. The Stakeholders, 
Resources, and Risk performance domains significantly impact the project outcome, which is defined 
by schedule, cost, and scope parameters. Additionally, other projects may compete for the same 
available resources at the same time and location. This competition for resources may considerably 
impact project costs, schedules, risks, scope, quality, and other project areas. 
The Estimate Resources process is closely coordinated with other processes, such as the Estimate 
Costs process, to help ensure a comprehensive approach to project planning and execution. This 
coordination is crucial as it helps to align the resource estimation with the project’s overall budget 
and financial constraints. Doing so helps ensure that the project remains financially viable and that 
resources are utilized optimally without unnecessary expenditure. 
Project managers are responsible for leading the team to work together to focus on what is 
essential at the project level. This coordination is achieved through the integration of processes, 
knowledge, and people. So, to integrate all of the performance domains and lead the project work, 
the project manager’s main concern should be to lead the project team to achieve the project 
objectives.
