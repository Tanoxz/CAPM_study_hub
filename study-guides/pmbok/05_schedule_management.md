2.3 Schedule Performance Domain 
Project scheduling provides a plan that represents how and when the project will deliver the 
products, services, and results defined in the project scope. The schedule serves as a tool for 
communication and for managing stakeholder expectations, and provides a basis for performance 
reporting. The project schedule also facilitates the proactive identification of potential delays and 
risks, enabling timely corrective actions to keep the project on track. 
2.3.1 Key Concepts 
Schedule management includes the processes required to oversee the project’s timely completion. 
The detailed project schedule should be flexible throughout the project to adjust for the knowledge 
gained, increased understanding of the risks and external influences, and value-added activities. 
Revising and maintaining the project schedule to sustain a realistic schedule should continue 
throughout the project. 
Schedules can be created and defined at various levels. The project team specifies the rules for 
the relative granularity of the level’s schedule activities in the overall schedule model. It should be 
noted that schedule levels can change depending on the approach (e.g., adaptive or predictive), 
practitioner, and organizational scheduling requirements. 
With project timelines continuously shrinking, there may be insufficient time to analyze the project 
details (sometimes, the details are also evolving). It may also be impossible to develop a detailed 
project schedule up front, even in projects using a predictive approach, so a growing number of 
project management practitioners are preparing detailed schedules progressively as their projects 
unfold. This effort involves initially outlining the broad milestones and key activities of a project and 
then refining and expanding upon them as more information becomes available or as the project 
progresses. This approach allows for flexibility and adjustment as the project evolves and more 
details become known. A well-known technique that helps with this approach is rolling wave planning. 
• 
The following key concepts support effective practices for the Schedule performance domain: 
Project schedule. The project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents 
linked activities with planned dates, durations, milestones, and resources. The project 
schedule may include start and finish dates; the total number of work periods required 
to complete an activity or WBS component, expressed in hours, days, or weeks (known 
as duration); significant points or events in a portfolio, program, or project (known as 
milestones); and resources. For further information, see Section 2.6 on the Resources 
performance domain. 
• 
Estimate. An estimate is a quantitative assessment of a variable’s likely amount or outcome, 
such as project effort or duration. Effort is the number of labor units required to complete a 
schedule activity or WBS component, often expressed in hours, days, or weeks. Duration is the 
number of work periods needed to complete individual activities with the estimated resources. 
• 
Schedule baseline. The schedule baseline is the approved version of a schedule model 
that can be changed using formal change control procedures and is used as the basis 
for comparison to actual results. The level of formality on change control procedures 
tends to be more rigid on projects using predictive approaches and more flexible, or even 
nonexistent, on projects using adaptive and agile approaches.

• 
Schedule flexibility. Flexibility is essential for adapting to changes, managing risks, and 
optimizing resource allocations. Flexibility enhances team morale, supports incremental 
delivery, and helps ensure higher-quality outcomes. 
• 
Schedule forecasts. Schedule forecasts are estimates or predictions of conditions and 
events in the project’s future based on information and knowledge available at the time the 
schedule is calculated. The schedule forecast predicts a timeline based on current progress, 
performance trends, and other information pertaining to the project. Forecasts are updated 
and reissued based on work performance obtained as the project is executed. 
• 
Actual duration. The actual duration is the time, in calendar units, between the actual 
start date of the schedule activity and the data date of the project schedule, if the schedule 
activity is in progress, or the actual finish date if the schedule activity is complete. 
• 
Project schedule network diagrams. A project schedule network diagram is a graphical 
representation of the logical relationships (also called dependencies) among the project 
schedule activities. Sequencing can be performed by using project management software. 
2.3.2 Processes 
The Schedule performance domain includes the processes required to manage the timely completion 
of the project. The following processes are included in the Schedule performance domain (see 
Figure 2-20): 
• 
Plan Schedule Management. The process of establishing policies, procedures, and 
documentation for designing, developing, managing, performing, and maintaining the 
schedule.

• 
Develop Schedule. The process of analyzing sequences, durations, resource requirements, 
and schedule constraints to create a schedule model for project execution and monitoring 
and controlling. 
• 
Monitor and Control Schedule. The process of monitoring the status of the project to 
update the project schedule, and managing changes to the schedule baseline or agreed-
upon schedule. 
2.3.2.1 Plan Schedule Management 
Plan Schedule Management is the process of establishing policies, procedures, and documentation 
for designing, developing, managing, performing, and maintaining the schedule. The key benefit of 
this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how the project schedule will be managed 
throughout the project (see Figure 2-21). 
The specific output of this process is the schedule management plan, including information on 
project schedule development, release and iteration length, level of accuracy, units of measurement, 
links to organizational procedures, project schedule maintenance, control thresholds, rules of 
performance measurement, and reporting formats. 
2.3.2.2 Develop Schedule 
Develop Schedule is the process of analyzing sequences, durations, resource requirements, 
and schedule constraints to create a schedule model for project execution and monitoring 
and controlling. Developing an acceptable project schedule is an iterative process. The 
schedule model is used to determine the planned start and finish dates for project activities 
and milestones based on the best available information. Schedule development may require 
the review and revision of duration estimates, resource estimates, and schedule reserves to 
establish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track progress (see 
Figure 2-22).

There are four steps to developing the schedule (see Figure 2-23): 
1. Define activities, 
2. Determine sequence, 
3. Estimate effort and duration, and 
4. Adjust. 
The work involved in each step is as follows: 
• 
Step 1: Define activities. The first step involves identifying and documenting the 
specific actions to be performed to produce the project deliverables. The key benefit of 
this process is that it decomposes work packages into schedule activities that provide a

For more information on work packages, see Section 2.2 on the Scope performance 
domain. 
◾ 
Artifacts for this step include the activity list, activity attributes, and milestones. 
• 
Step 2: Determine sequence. Once the activities have been defined, the next step is to 
determine the logical sequence in which the work will be carried out. This effort involves 
determining the dependencies and relationships among the schedule elements, or 
which activities should be completed before others can begin (e.g., start-to-start, finish-
to-finish, start-to-finish, finish-to-start). The key benefit of this process is that it defines 
the logical sequence of work to obtain the greatest efficiency, given all of the project 
constraints. 
◾ 
Every work package and activity, except for the first and last, should be connected 
to at least one predecessor and at least one successor activity, with an appropriate 
logical relationship. Logical relationships should be designed to create a realistic project 
schedule. It may be necessary to use lead or lag time between activities to support a 
realistic and achievable project schedule. 
◾ 
Note: Depending on the degree of decomposition, the sequence can be determined 
at different levels, including the level of the control account, the work package, or the 
activity.

• 
Step 3: Estimate effort and duration. Estimating effort and duration is about determining 
the number of work periods (hours, days, weeks, or other) needed to complete individual 
activities with estimated resources. The key benefit of this process is that it provides the 
amount of time and effort each activity will take to complete. 
◾ 
Estimating effort and duration uses information from the scope of work, required 
resource types or skill levels, estimated resource quantities, and resource calendars. 
(For more information, see the Scope performance domain in Section 2.2 and the 
Resources performance domain in Section 2.6). The estimates can be based on the 
following techniques: 
▶ 
Expert judgment, 
▶ 
Delphi technique, 
▶ 
Analogous estimating, 
▶ 
Parametric estimating, 
▶ 
Program evaluation and review technique (PERT), 
▶ 
Bottom-up estimating, 
▶ 
Planning poker, 
▶ 
Story points, 
▶ 
T-shirt sizing, and 
▶ 
Many others. 
◾ 
Factors that may influence the duration estimates include constraints imposed on the 
duration, effort involved, or type of resources (e.g., fixed duration, fixed effort or work, 
fixed number of resources, the experience of the team executing the activity, and the 
risk involved in the activity), as well as the schedule network analysis technique used. 
The inputs for the estimates of duration originate from the person or group on the 
project team that is most familiar with the nature of the work for the specific activity. 
◾ 
The duration estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considers the 
quality and availability of the input data. For example, as more detailed and precise 
data are available about the project engineering and design work, the accuracy and 
quality of the duration estimates may improve. 
◾ 
Estimating effort and duration requires an estimation of the amount of work effort 
required to complete the activity as well as the estimated number of available 
resources. These estimates are used to approximate the number of work periods 
(activity duration) needed to complete the activity using the appropriate project and 
resource calendars. 
◾ 
In many cases, the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish 
an activity, along with the skill proficiency levels of those resources, may determine the 
activity’s duration. A change to a driving resource allocated to the activity will usually 
influence the duration. 
◾ 
Sometimes, the intrinsic nature of the work (i.e., constraints imposed on the duration, 
effort involved, or number of resources) will take a predetermined amount of time to 
complete, regardless of the resource allocation (e.g., a 24-hour stress test).

--- Page 158 ---

Other factors to consider when estimating duration may include: 
◾ 
Law of diminishing returns. When one factor (e.g., a resource) used to determine the 
effort required to produce a unit of work is increased while all other factors remain 
fixed, a point will eventually be reached at which additions of that one factor start to 
yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output. 
◾ 
Number of resources. Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of 
resources does not always reduce the time by half, as it may increase duration due to extra 
risk. At some point, adding too many resources to the activity may increase duration due 
to knowledge transfer, learning curves, additional coordination, and other factors involved. 
◾ 
Advances in technology. Technology advances may also play an important role 
in determining duration estimates. For example, an increase in the output of a 
manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology, 
which may impact duration and resource needs. 
◾ 
Documentation. All data and assumptions that support duration estimating are 
documented for each activity duration estimate. 
◾ 
Level of decomposition. The estimate can be made at distinct levels, at the level of the 
control account, or at the work package or activity level. 
◾ 
Cognitive bias. Biases such as planning fallacy and end-of-story illusion, and other 
phenomena like Hofstadter’s law or even the motivation of team members, may also 
impact the accuracy of the scheduling process. 
• 
Step 4: Adjust. This step entails reviewing the draft schedule, based on the sequence, estimates, 
and resources accumulated in the previous steps. If the draft schedule is unacceptable, various 
techniques can be applied to adjust those components to find alternative schedule options. 
◾ 
Once finalized, the schedule contains a series of unique activities that have varying 
durations and are linked by defined logical relationships. The schedule provides the 
project team with information about what work should be done, and in what sequence 
the project deliverables should be accomplished. 
◾ 
After the start and end dates of the activities have been set, it is common for the 
project team members assigned to the activities to review their assignments. The team 
members should confirm that the start and end dates do not conflict with resource 
calendars or assigned activities in other projects or tasks and are therefore still valid. The 
schedule is then analyzed to identify conflicts with logical relationships and to determine 
if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved and used as a baseline. 
◾ 
With a draft schedule, it is easier and more accurate to estimate the labor and physical 
resources required to complete the project objectives. Those resource estimates may 
influence the decision as to whether the draft schedule is or is not acceptable, and thus 
may require further adjustment and revision. 
2.3.2.3 Monitor and Control Schedule 
Monitor and Control Schedule is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update 
the project schedule and managing changes to the agreed-upon schedule. Updating the schedule 
requires knowing the actual or forecasted performance to date. The key benefit of this process is 
maintaining a realistic schedule throughout the duration of the project (see Figure 2-24).

When using a predictive approach, any change to the schedule baseline or agreed-upon schedule 
can only be approved through the Assess and Implement Changes process by applying integrated 
change control. Monitor and Control Schedule, as part of the Monitoring and Controlling Focus Area, 
is concerned with the following: 
• 
Determining the status of the project schedule, 
• 
Influencing the factors that create schedule changes, 
• 
Reconsidering necessary schedule reserves, 
• 
Determining if the overall project schedule has changed, and 
• 
Managing the actual changes as they occur. 
When an adaptive or agile approach is used, the Monitor and Control Schedule process is concerned 
with the following: 
• 
Determining the status of the project schedule by comparing the total amount of work 
delivered and accepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed time cycle;

• 
Conducting retrospectives (scheduled reviews to record lessons learned) for correcting 
processes and improving them, if required; 
• 
Reprioritizing the remaining work plan (backlog); 
• 
Determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted 
(velocity) in the given time per iteration (agreed-upon work cycle duration, typically 2 weeks 
or 1 month); 
• 
Determining that the project schedule has changed; and 
• 
Managing the actual changes as they occur. 
When work is being contracted, regular and milestone status updates from contractors and suppliers 
are a means of ensuring that the work is progressing as agreed to ensure that the schedule is under 
control. Scheduled status reviews and walkthroughs are expected to help ensure that the contractor’s 
reports are accurate and complete. 
2.3.3 Tailoring Considerations 
Project managers may need to tailor and adapt the way that a project’s schedule management 
processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to life cycle and 
development approach selection, product and deliverable attributes, project team attributes, 
culture, project environments, scheduling approaches and methods, and trends and emerging 
practices. 
2.3.3.1 Life Cycle and Development Approach Selection 
The choice of project life cycle and development approach can significantly influence how scheduling 
processes are tailored and applied throughout the project as follows: 
• 
Predictive life cycle. In a predictive life cycle, the schedule is typically defined up front. 
Detailed planning and sequencing of tasks are done at the beginning, the project baseline 
is created and approved, and changes are less frequent. Usually, the changes to the project 
baseline are conducted through formal change management procedures. Tailoring in this 
context involves setting a comprehensive timeline with clear milestones, dependencies, and 
critical paths. 
• 
Adaptive life cycle. In adaptive projects, schedules are more flexible. The project is divided 
into sprints or iterations with short-term planning horizons. Tailoring in adaptive projects 
involves creating timeboxed schedules that can adapt to changes in the project scope and 
priorities. 
• 
Hybrid life cycle. In a hybrid development approach, scheduling combines the flexibility 
of adaptive methods with the structured planning of a predictive approach. The high-level 
project schedule is planned to use predictive techniques to outline key milestones and 
deliverables. Within this framework, the subordinate project streams can use adaptive or 
predictive methods depending on their characteristics. Adaptive sprints or iterations are 
used to manage the detailed execution of project components with a high rate of change 
in requirements, allowing for adaptability and the frequent reassessment of priorities. 
Other components may use Kanban or the critical path method. This approach can help 
ensure that the overall project stays on track and that teams can respond quickly to 
changes and continuously improve the deliverables.

2.3.3.2 Product and Deliverable Attributes 
The product and deliverable attributes can influence the tailoring of scheduling processes based on 
the following factors: 
• 
Compliance/criticality. High-criticality projects (i.e., very important projects for the 
performing organization’s strategic goals) may require more detailed and frequent schedule 
updates to ensure compliance and mitigate risks. 
• 
Type and technology. The type of deliverable and the technology involved can dictate the 
level of detail required in the schedule. New or innovative technologies may require more 
iterative scheduling due to the uncertainty associated with the project domain. 
2.3.3.3 Project Team Attributes 
The project team attributes can also influence the tailoring of scheduling processes depending on 
considerations such as the following: 
• 
Size and distribution. The size and geographical distribution of the project team can affect 
how the schedule is communicated and maintained. Large, dispersed teams may need 
more sophisticated scheduling tools and regular updates. 
• 
Experience. The experience levels of the team members can influence how detailed the 
schedule should be. Experienced teams may be able to use a less-detailed, high-level 
schedule, whereas less-experienced teams might require a more detailed, step-by-step plan. 
2.3.3.4 Culture 
Culture can influence the tailoring of scheduling processes depending on considerations such as the 
following: 
• 
Organizational culture. The culture of the organization, including its tolerance for 
uncertainty and change, affects how flexible or rigid the schedule should be. An adaptive 
culture may embrace more fluid schedules, whereas a risk-averse culture may prefer 
detailed, fixed schedules. Culture can also be driven by industry factors. For example, 
pharmaceutical companies follow strict processes for product development, whereas 
technology companies tend to be more aggressive toward assuming risks. 
• 
Buy-in and trust. High levels of trust and buy-in from stakeholders can enable more 
flexible scheduling practices, whereas low levels may require more formal and detailed 
scheduling. 
2.3.3.5 Project Environment 
The project environment can influence the tailoring of scheduling processes depending on 
considerations such as: 
• 
Project scale and environment. The scale of the project (e.g., megaprojects versus small 
projects) and the project environment (e.g., commercial, government, or nonprofit) can 
influence the level of detail and frequency of schedule updates. 
• 
Project goals and timeframe. Projects with aggressive timelines or critical deadlines may 
require more rigorous scheduling to ensure timely delivery.

2.3.3.6 Scheduling Approaches and Methods 
As different types of industries and projects require different approaches and methods to scheduling, 
it is increasingly important to have a contextual framework for effective adoption and tailoring of 
development practices to respond to the changing demands of the environment. Some approaches 
for scheduling include the critical path method, critical chain method, location-based scheduling,  
Last Planner System®, Gantt charts, and Kanban. 
• 
Location-based scheduling (LBS). Location-based scheduling allocates quantities to 
the locations defined in the LBS and takes into consideration the resourcing required to 
complete this work, including production rates, crew sizing, logic between tasks, and any 
requirements for splitting or buffering work. 
• 
Lean scheduling. Lean scheduling is based on the principles of lean project delivery (on-
demand scheduling) and is designed to minimize waste and maximize value. To achieve 
this goal, deliverables are not assigned to the team. Lean scheduling principles point to 
the importance of limiting queues by pulling work when there is capacity to place the 
work into the process. The project team members collaborate in pull-planning sessions 
where the essential activities, durations, and handoffs between trades to complete 
milestones are defined. The main steps are master scheduling, phase scheduling, and 
look-ahead planning. 
• 
Schedule and deliverable alignment. Project deliverables and schedules have varying 
levels of detail. This variation often creates confusion regarding what will be done and 
when. One approach to increase clarity is to ensure that a given element of the WBS is 
described by a schedule that has a commensurate level of detail. 
2.3.4 Interactions With Other Domains 
The Schedule performance domain closely interacts with the Governance, Scope, Finance, 
Stakeholders, Resources, and Risk performance domains, emphasizing the interdependent nature 
of project management elements. At the beginning of the project, the expected outcomes are 
identified, and a high-level schedule is developed to achieve these results. Depending on the selected 
development approach and life cycle, intensive scheduling may be conducted up front, which is then 
adjusted or adapted to the actual environment. 
Other life cycles encourage just enough scheduling at various points throughout the project, with the 
expectation that plans will evolve. The duration of the project depends on its scope, cost, resources, 
and quality. Each of these factors can cause the schedule to become longer or shorter. 
The Scope, Schedule, and Finance performance domains are closely linked to one another and 
changes in any one of them will likely impact the others. While the project outcome is directly 
dependent on these performance domains, they also are in parallel to, and indirectly connected with, 
the Stakeholders, Resources, and Risk performance domains in order to maintain a balance and 
ensure that all of the domains function under the Governance performance domain. 
2.3.5 Check Results 
Activities related to the Schedule performance domain should be considered successful only if they 
contribute to specific outcomes. Table 2-7 shows a set of sample target outcomes, along with a 
potential check to confirm whether those outcomes are met.
