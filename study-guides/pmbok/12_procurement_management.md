Appendix X4 
Procurement 
X4.1 Procurement Introduction 
Procurement management plays a significant role in project management, involving the acquisition 
of goods, services, or results from external sources to meet project objectives. A buyer is an entity 
that purchases products or services, whereas the seller, vendor, contractor, or supplier is the entity 
that provides products or services. In a procurement and supply chain context, the buyer–seller 
relationship is characterized by information asymmetry and is a source of multiple relevant risks, as 
each party may possess different levels of information about the transaction. Procurement practices 
can influence project outcomes by impacting cost efficiency, quality standards, and timely delivery. 
In today’s complex business environment, where projects often rely on specialized expertise and 
resources from external suppliers, understanding procurement management is essential for project 
managers. 
Procurement is not classified as a separate performance domain in A Guide to the Project Management 
Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide). This decision reflects the unique position of procurement within 
organizational structures. Typically, project procurements are integrated into—or extend from— 
the larger organization’s procurement department, leveraging established processes, policies, and 
vendor relationships, which ensures consistency across projects and allows for economies of scale. 
However, it is important to note that some large-scale or specialized projects may have dedicated 
procurement teams, operating with a degree of autonomy while still aligning with organizational 
standards. 
This appendix provides a detailed understanding of procurement in projects. It covers the overall 
procurement flow, strategies for effective procurement management, make-or-buy analysis, source 
selection processes, and various contract types. Additionally, it addresses claim administration 
and alternative dispute-resolution methods. Throughout this appendix, good practices, such as 
establishing strong procurement policies, automating procurement processes, and implementing 
robust monitoring systems for key performance indicators (KPIs), are highlighted. Effective 
procurement practices significantly influence project success by ensuring cost efficiency, adherence 
to quality standards, risk mitigation, and timely delivery.

X4.2 Procurement Overview 
Project procurement management encompasses the essential processes required to develop and 
administer agreements such as contracts, purchase orders, memoranda of agreements (MOAs), or 
service-level agreements (SLAs). These processes help ensure that the procurement of goods and 
services necessary for the project can be handled efficiently and effectively. The personnel authorized 
to procure these goods and services may include members of the project team, management, or 
members of the organization’s purchasing department, depending on the organizational structure. 
Effective procurement management involves a series of activities designed to oversee and control 
procurement activities throughout the project life cycle. 
The first stage in project procurement management is identifying the procurement needs and 
then planning for the same. During this phase, project managers or members of the purchasing 
department should involve key stakeholders early in the planning stage to ensure alignment 
on procurement objectives and constraints and document the decisions, as well as specify the 
procurement standards rules and regulations and identify potential sellers. This process involves 
conducting a thorough analysis of the project’s needs, determining the resources required, and 
deciding whether to procure these resources internally or externally. The process also includes 
preparing procurement documents such as requests for proposals (RFPs) or invitations for bids (IFBs) 
(also called an invitation to tender [ITT]), which are then shared with potential sellers to solicit their 
responses. Proper planning ensures that all procurement activities align with the project’s objectives 
and constraints. 
The next stage is conducting the procurements. This step involves obtaining responses from 
potential sellers, evaluating these responses, selecting the most suitable seller, and awarding the 
contract. During this stage, it is crucial to ensure that the procurement process is transparent and 
fair, providing equal opportunities for all potential sellers to participate, as well as to ensure that the 
queries raised by bidders through requests for information (RFIs) are duly and adequately addressed. 
The selection of a seller should be based on predefined criteria such as cost, quality, and the seller’s 
ability to meet the project requirements and timelines. Once a seller is selected, the contract is 
negotiated and finalized, outlining the terms and conditions under which the goods or services will be 
provided. 
The final stage in the procurement process is monitoring and controlling procurements. This step 
involves managing procurement relationships, monitoring contract performance, and making 
necessary changes and corrections. Effective contract management can ensure that the seller 
meets their obligations and that the project receives the required goods and services on time 
and within budget. Any issues or discrepancies should be addressed promptly to avoid delays or 
additional costs. The process also includes closing out contracts once the procurement activities 
are completed, ensuring that all contractual obligations have been fulfilled and there are no 
outstanding issues. This stage is critical for ensuring the procurement process supports the overall 
success of the project. 
X4.3 Make-or-Buy Analysis 
A make-or-buy analysis is used to determine whether work or deliverables can best be accomplished 
by the project team or should be purchased from outside sources.

--- Page 352 ---

Make-or-buy analysis may use payback period, return on investment (ROI), internal rate of return 
(IRR), discounted cash flow, net present value (NPV), cost-benefit analysis, or other techniques in 
order to decide whether to include something as part of the project or purchase it externally. 
Factors to consider in the make-or-buy decision include the organization’s current resource 
allocation, their skills and abilities, the need for specialized expertise, the desire to avoid expanding 
permanent employment obligations, and the need for independent expertise. This decision process 
also includes evaluating the risks involved with each make-or-buy decision. 
X4.4 Procurement Strategy 
Once the make-or-buy analysis is complete and the decision is made to acquire from outside the 
project, a procurement strategy should be identified. The objective of the procurement strategy 
is to determine the project delivery method, the type of legally binding agreement(s), and how 
the procurement will advance through the procurement phases. The following factors should be 
considered: 
• 
Delivery methods. Delivery methods are different for professional services versus 
construction projects. 
• 
For professional services, delivery methods include buyer/services provider with no 
subcontracting, buyer/services provider with subcontracting allowed, joint venture between 
buyer and services provider, and buyer/services provider acts as the representative. 
• 
For industrial, integration, or build-out supply projects, project delivery methods 
include turnkey, design-build (DB), design-bid-build (DBB), design-build-operate (DBO), 
build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT), and others. 
• 
Integrated project delivery (IPD) contracts represent a more formalized and structured 
approach to collaborative project delivery. These contracts are typically used in complex 
construction projects where early involvement of all parties can significantly benefit the 
project outcome. Key characteristics of IPD contracts may include the following: 
◾ 
Multiparty agreement involving all key stakeholders (owner, designer, contractor); 
◾ 
Shared risks and rewards based on project outcomes; 
◾ 
Early involvement of key participants for better integration of expertise; 
◾ 
Collaborative decision-making leveraging the combined expertise of all parties; and 
◾ 
Open-book accounting for financial transparency. 
• 
Procurement phases. The procurement strategy may also include information on 
procurement phases. Incorporating digital tools like procurement management software 
can streamline phase transitions and help ensure real-time tracking of milestones. 
Information on procurement phases may include the following: 
◾ 
Sequencing or phasing of the procurement, a description of each phase, and the 
specific objectives of each phase; 
◾ 
Procurement performance indicators and milestones to be used in monitoring;

X4.5 Bid Process and Documents 
The bid process includes developing and publicizing bid documents, bidder conferences, and 
selecting a bidder. Bid documents may include the following: 
• 
Request for information (RFI). An RFI is used to gather more information from the market 
prior to sending out bid documents to a set of selected vendors. 
• 
Request for proposal (RFP). An RFP is used for projects with a complex or complicated 
scope where the buyer is looking for the vendor to provide a solution. 
• 
Request for quote (RFQ). An RFQ is used when price is the main deciding factor and the 
proposed solution is readily available. 
These three types of documents cover the majority of bidding needs. There are other bid documents; 
however, they tend to be industry specific. 
Once the bid documents are distributed, the buyer generally has a bidder conference to respond to 
bidder questions and provide clarifying information. The bidders then develop their responses and 
deliver them to the buyer by the date specified in the bid documents. 
Choosing the best vendor, sometimes known as source selection, is often based on a number of 
criteria, such as experience, references, price, and timely delivery. These variables may be weighted 
to reflect the relative importance of each. The buyer evaluates vendor bids against the criteria 
to select an appropriate vendor(s). The buyer and vendor then negotiate terms and conditions. 
Almost everything can be negotiated, from cost to delivery and payment dates, to location of work, 
ownership of intellectual property, and so forth. Figure X4-1 illustrates an example of how these steps 
might flow together.

X4.6 Source Selection Analysis 
It is necessary to review the prioritization of the competing demands for the project before deciding 
on the selection method. Since competitive selection methods may require sellers to invest a large 
amount of time and resources up front, it is a good practice to include the evaluation method in 
the tender documents so bidders know how they will be evaluated. This transparency helps infuse 
stakeholder trust in the selection method. Commonly used selection methods include the following: 
• 
Least cost. The least cost method may be appropriate for procurements of a standard or 
routine nature where well-established practices and standards exist and from which a specific 
and well-defined outcome is expected that can be executed at different costs. In more 
complex procurements, least cost should be avoided as it may negatively impact quality. 
• 
Qualifications only. The qualifications-only selection method applies when the time and 
cost of a full selection process would not make sense because the value of the procurement 
is relatively small. The buyer establishes a short list and selects the bidder with the 
strongest qualifications, expertise, and references. 
• 
Quality-based/highest technical proposal score. The selected firm is asked to submit a 
proposal with both technical and cost details and is then invited to negotiate the contract 
if the technical proposal proves acceptable. Using this method, technical proposals are 
first evaluated based on the quality of the technical solution offered. The seller that 
submitted the highest ranked technical proposal is selected if their financial proposal can 
be negotiated and accepted. 
• 
Quality and cost based. The quality-and-cost-based method allows cost to be included as 
a factor in the seller-selection process. In general, when risk and/or uncertainty are greater 
for the project, quality should be a key element when compared to cost. 
• 
Single source. Single-source procurement is a formal process where only one supplier 
can satisfy the technical requirements due to unique technical competence and expertise. 
This method is used when there is only one source verified to possess patents or exclusive 
rights to manufacture and furnish the item or service. It is not an attempt to contract with a 
favored provider but is employed when no other options are available. 
• 
Fixed budget. The fixed-budget method requires disclosing the available budget to 
invited sellers in the request and selecting the highest ranking technical proposal within 
the budget. Because sellers are subject to a cost constraint, they will adapt the scope and 
quality of their offer to that budget. The buyer should therefore ensure that the budget is 
compatible with the statement of work (SOW) and that the seller will be able to perform 
the tasks within the budget. This method is appropriate only when the SOW is precisely 
defined, no changes are anticipated, and the budget is fixed and cannot be exceeded. 
X4.7 Source Selection Criteria 
In choosing evaluation criteria, the buyer seeks to ensure that the proposal selected will offer the 
best quality for the services required. The source selection criteria may include but are not limited to 
the following: 
• 
Capability and capacity; 
• 
Product cost and life cycle cost;

• 
Delivery dates; 
• 
Regulatory, compliance, or industry standards expertise or experience; 
• 
Technical expertise and approach; 
• 
Specific relevant experience; 
• 
Adequacy of the proposed approach and work plan in responding to the SOW; 
• 
Key team members’ qualifications, availability, and competences; 
• 
Financial stability of the firm; 
• 
Management experience; 
• 
Suitability of the knowledge transfer program, including training; and 
• 
Sustainability credentials of the supplier. 
For international projects, evaluation criteria may include “local content” requirements (e.g., 
participation by nationals among proposed key team members). This approach provides a more 
relevant cultural understanding. 
The specific criteria may be a numerical score, color code, or a written description of how well the 
seller satisfies the buying organization’s needs. The criteria will be part of a weighting system that 
can be used to select a single seller that will be asked to sign a contract and establish a negotiating 
sequence by ranking all the proposals by the weighted evaluation scores assigned to each 
proposal. 
X4.8 Contract Type 
Understanding various contract types is crucial for project managers, as it directly impacts project 
risk allocation, collaboration dynamics, and overall project success. Contract types define the terms 
and conditions under which goods, services, or results are acquired from external sources. Contract 
types establish the framework for financial arrangements, risk distribution, and the nature of 
relationships among project stakeholders. 
Project managers should approach contract types from a dual perspective: as both a contractor 
and a client/customer. This dual viewpoint is essential because projects often involve both roles— 
contracting vendors as a customer and being contracted by clients. The project manager should 
consider both of these vantage points in order to successfully support effective procurement. 
Each contract type has its advantages and disadvantages, and there are potential ways to exploit 
contractual terms. However, the goal should always be to structure contracts in a way that benefits 
all parties, creating a win-win scenario that fosters collaboration and project success. 
In this appendix, we will explore two main categories of contract types: established contract models 
and collaborative contract models. By understanding these contract types and their implications, 
project managers can make informed decisions when selecting or negotiating contracts, balancing 
risk allocation, incentivizing performance, and creating collaborative environments that contribute to 
project success.

X4.8.1 Fundamental Contract Models 
Some of the more common contract models and how they can be viewed from both the client and 
contractor perspectives are as follows (Please note that the types and names of contract types can 
vary in different industries and organizations.): 
• 
Fixed-price contract. Fixed-price contracts are agreements that establish a predetermined 
fee against a clearly defined scope of work, transferring cost risk to the seller while offering 
budget predictability for the buyer. Fixed-price contracts are common in construction 
projects, product development, and service delivery where the work can be accurately 
estimated. 
◾ 
Client perspective: Provides budget certainty but may result in higher prices due to 
risk premiums. 
◾ 
Contractor perspective: Offers profit potential if managed efficiently but bears the 
risk of cost overruns. 
• 
Cost-reimbursable contract. Cost-reimbursable contracts are a type of contract involving 
payment to the seller for the seller’s actual costs, plus a fee typically representing the 
seller’s profit. These contracts are used when the project scope is uncertain or when 
the project is high risk. Cost-reimbursable contracts are common in research and 
development projects, complex construction projects, and situations where flexibility is 
needed. 
◾ 
Client perspective: Allows for flexibility but carries the risk of cost escalation. 
◾ 
Contractor perspective: Reduces financial risk but may limit profit potential. 
• 
Time and materials (T&M) contract. T&M contracts are a type of contract that is a hybrid 
contractual arrangement containing aspects of both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price 
contracts. The buyer typically pays for actual time and materials used plus a profit margin. 
These contracts are often used for smaller projects, maintenance work, or when the scope 
is not clearly defined at the outset. T&M contracts are common in technology services, 
consulting, and some construction projects. 
◾ 
Client perspective: Provides flexibility but requires close monitoring to control costs. 
◾ 
Contractor perspective: Ensures cost coverage but may lead to scrutiny of time and 
resource usage. 
• 
Target-cost contract. Target-cost contracts set a target cost, with provisions for sharing 
cost savings or overruns between the buyer and seller. These contracts are used to 
encourage efficiency and cost control while maintaining flexibility. Target-cost contracts are 
often seen in large infrastructure projects or complex manufacturing projects. 
◾ 
Client perspective: Encourages cost control but requires clear definition of target costs 
and sharing mechanisms. 
◾ 
Contractor perspective: Offers incentives for efficiency but bears partial risk of cost 
overruns. 
Moreover, there can be several hybrid contracts depending on the project requirements, which 
may incorporate elements of both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable models or other provisions for 
flexibility.

X4.8.2 Emerging Trends in Contract Management 
While the fundamental contract types (fixed-price, cost-reimbursable, and T&M contracts) remain 
the foundation of project procurement, several emerging trends, driven by advancements in AI and 
automation, are reshaping how these contracts are structured, executed, and managed. AI-powered 
contract analysis tools now enable more accurate risk assessments, faster negotiation processes, and 
better compliance monitoring. Additionally, machine learning algorithms help predict cost overruns 
and optimize contract terms by analyzing historical project data. As AI continues to evolve, it is 
enhancing decision-making, improving contract performance tracking, and enabling more dynamic 
and adaptive contract management practices. Some of the emerging practices include the following: 
• 
Agile contracting. Agile contracting is the application of agile principles to fundamental 
contract types, focusing on flexibility, iterative delivery, and continuous collaboration (e.g., a 
T&M contract with iteration-based deliverables). 
• 
Smart contracts. Smart contracts consist of the integration of blockchain technology 
with traditional contract structures and the automated execution of contract items. Smart 
contracts enhance transparency and reduce intermediaries. This contract type is usually 
implemented in milestone-based payments. 
• 
Outcome-based contracts. Outcome-based contracts are a shift from input-based pricing 
models. This contract type is applicable to fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts and 
focuses on measurable results rather than prescribed processes. 
• 
Sustainable contracting. Sustainable contracting is the practice of embedding 
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles into contractual agreements 
to promote measurable sustainability outcomes, ensuring alignment with broader 
organizational goals and societal expectations. 
• 
Collaborative contracting. Collaborative contracts use an enhanced risk-sharing or 
reward-sharing mechanism within fundamental contract types. This type of contract 
focuses on joint problem-solving and shared objectives (e.g., including a cap on a T&M 
contract, a reduced rate, or performance incentives). 
As project environments continue to evolve, so should the approaches to contract management. 
These emerging trends demonstrate how traditional contracts are being adapted to meet the 
demands of modern projects, incorporating technological advancements, sustainability concerns, 
and collaborative methodologies. By understanding these emerging practices, project managers 
can enhance contract flexibility, improve risk management, and foster stronger collaborative 
relationships with vendors and stakeholders, ultimately contributing to successful project outcomes. 
X4.9 Claims Administration 
Claims and disputes are common in project management, occurring across various industries and 
project types with differing frequency and impact. In construction projects, disputes can significantly 
affect finances, with direct costs ranging from 0.5% to 5% of the total contract value. Time and cost 
overruns, often caused by variation orders, are among the primary factors leading to disputable 
claims.

--- Page 358 ---

 
 
 
 
As projects grow in complexity and involve more stakeholders, the likelihood of disputes increases. 
Therefore, it is essential for project managers to be proficient in claims administration and familiar 
with alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods. Types of ADR include the following: 
• 
Negotiation. Negotiation involves direct discussions between parties to resolve disputes 
without third-party intervention. 
• 
Mediation. Mediation brings in a neutral third party to facilitate discussions between 
disputing parties to reach a mutually acceptable solution. 
• 
Arbitration. Arbitration is a more formal process where an arbitrator or panel hears both 
sides and makes a binding decision. 
• 
Dispute review boards. A dispute review board is a panel of neutral experts appointed at 
the start of a project to provide ongoing dispute avoidance and resolution. 
• 
Expert determination. Expert determination is when an independent expert is appointed 
to make a decision on a specific technical or financial issue. 
• 
Litigation. If all other means are exhausted but the disagreement between the 
stakeholders persists, litigation becomes the last option, where the dispute is referred to a 
court to be resolved. 
X4.9.1 Relevance to Project Managers 
Project managers play a crucial role in claims administration and dispute resolution. Project 
professionals should understand contract terms thoroughly to identify potential areas of dispute and 
manage risks proactively. Project managers should maintain detailed records of all project activities, 
changes, and communications to support potential claims. They should also foster open and clear 
communication among all stakeholders to help minimize misunderstandings that could lead to 
disputes. Recognizing potential conflicts early and addressing them promptly to prevent escalation 
are critical aspects of a project professional’s job. 
To effectively handle claims and disputes, project managers should seek to improve their negotiation 
and conflict-resolution skills, as this is likely to be the first engagement in a dispute or claim. In 
addition, some form of legal training or introduction to contract law and claims management during 
the early stages of a project is beneficial. 
AI-powered tools can also play a crucial role by analyzing contract terms, identifying potential 
areas of dispute, and offering predictive insights into the likelihood of claims. Project managers can 
leverage AI to assess the risks associated with specific clauses and use data-driven insights to guide 
negotiations. 
Establishing a strong working relationship with the organization’s legal team for guidance and 
support is essential. Additionally, AI can enhance this collaboration by providing real-time contract 
analytics, tracking potential risks, and recommending proactive measures to resolve issues before 
they escalate.

X4.9.2 Sensitivity of Legal Actions and Upholding Ethics Codes 
Project managers should be acutely aware of the sensitivity surrounding legal actions and the 
potential impact on project relationships. Key considerations include the following: 
• 
Nuanced communication. Be mindful of the language used in all written communications, 
including emails, as these can be used as evidence in legal proceedings. 
• 
Escalation protocols. Establish clear protocols for when and how to escalate disputes 
to legal action, considering the potential long-term consequences on stakeholder 
relationships. 
• 
Confidentiality. Maintain strict confidentiality regarding dispute details to protect all 
parties involved and comply with legal requirements. 
• 
Impartiality. Strive to remain objective and impartial when dealing with claims, focusing on 
facts rather than emotions or personal relationships. 
By understanding the intricacies of claims administration and ADR, project managers can navigate 
these challenging aspects of project management more effectively, minimizing the negative impact 
on project outcomes and stakeholder relationships.

Appendix X5 
Evolution of the PMBOK® Guide 
Since its inception as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) in 1987, A Guide to 
the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) has evolved while recognizing that 
fundamental elements of project management endure. Its evolution has captured significant and 
substantive changes in the nature of the content. A sampling of some of those key changes is 
reflected in Table X5-1. 
X5.1 Evidence-Based 
In preparation for development work of the eighth edition, PMI actively engaged in a multiphased 
research effort, engaging with stakeholders on a global level. PMI also partnered with a third-party 
consulting firm to guide research and ensure the study was free from organizational bias. 
• 
Phase 1—Qualitative. This phase consisted of live, chat-based discussions over 2 days with 
a mix of project managers, including representatives from seven different countries. This 
phase enabled the discovery of themes and identified market needs for further validation. 
Participants were required to have familiarity with the seventh edition and at least one prior 
edition. 
• 
Phase 2—Quantitative. In Phase 2, it was critical to validate and quantify hypotheses from 
Phase 1 on a global level. An online survey was sent to approximately 64,000 professionals 
who downloaded the seventh edition, with a response rate of just over 3,400 completions. 
Representation included a population across all PMI regions, a mix of early-, mid-, and late-
career stages, with both Project Management Professional (PMP)® certification holders and 
non-PMP practitioners. 
• 
Phase 3—Draft feedback. A team of 25 volunteers used the evidence from Phases 1 and 2 
to iterate toward a full draft. PMI broadcast that draft to the community and yielded nearly 
9,000 comments and suggestions. The feedback reinforced which elements were strong 
and which needed refinement. 
• 
Phase 4—ANSI review. The core development team leveraged the feedback to refine 
a final draft, which was submitted to ANSI for formal review. That review resulted in 
approximately 3,900 additional practitioner comments, further validating the product.

Table X5-1. Evolutionary Changes of the PMBOK® Guide 
PMBOK® 
Guide Edition 
Key Evolutionary Changes 
1996 
• Distinguished as “a guide to the body of knowledge,” rather than the body of  
knowledge for project management. 
• Refected the subset of the project management body of knowledge that is “generally 
accepted,” meaning applicable to most projects most of the time, with widespread 
consensus that practices have value and usefulness. 
•  Defned project management as “the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and 
techniques to project activities in order to meet or exceed stakeholder needs and 
expectations from a project.” 
• Specifc decision to shift to a process-based standard driven by a desire to show 
interactions among Knowledge Areas; create a robust and fexible structure; and  
recognize that International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and other 
standards organizations were establishing process-based standards. 
Third (2004) 
•  First edition to incorporate the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) “ANSI 
standard” logo on the cover. 
• First edition to formally designate The Standard for Project Management of a Project 
separate and distinct from the Project Management Framework and Body of Knowledge. 
• Included material “generally recognized as good practice on most projects most of 
the time.” 
• Defned project management as “the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and 
techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements.” 
Sixth (2017) 
•  First edition to make a distinct separation between the ANSI standard and the guide. 
•  First time “agile” content is incorporated into the text, not just referenced in examples. 
•  Expansion of Knowledge Area front material, including key concepts, trends and 
emerging practices, tailoring considerations, and considerations for agile/adaptive 
environments. 
Seventh (2021) 
•  First edition in which project management is characterized as a “system for value 
delivery,” with an attendant shift in focus toward a more holistic, value-oriented 
mindset, and less emphasis on project management mechanics. 
•  First edition in which project management principles were elaborated. 
• Agile thinking and methods became more fully integrated compared to the sixth edition. 
• Shift from a process-based guide to a principles-based ANSI standard. 
• Shift from Knowledge Areas focused on processes to performance domains focused 
on results.

X5.2 Changes in the Eighth Edition 
The results of market discovery offered clear and definitive findings that informed the content plan of 
the eighth edition. Key findings included the following: 
• 
Simplify the principles. A significant number of respondents—88%—supported a 
principle-based standard, emphasizing the importance of project management principles. 
However, respondents also said principles should be more actionable and less confusing. 
Specifically, principles should have connection with performance domains while not 
overlapping. For example, a specific topic, such as engaging stakeholders, should not be 
formalized as both a principle and a performance domain. 
• 
Reintroduce Process Groups as Focus Areas. A majority—80% of respondents— 
supported the reintroduction and refinement of Process Groups as foundational concepts 
within The Standard for Project Management. A full two-thirds of respondents also 
indicated these five historically accepted concepts are agnostic of development approach 
(e.g., adaptive, predictive, or hybrid). This edition reintroduces Initiating, Planning, 
Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing as Project Management Focus Areas, 
which can be performed via formal processes, informal practices, or policies. This 
approach was further validated by community feedback received through public exposure 
comment periods. 
• 
Reintroduce processes. Again, 79% of respondents recommended that technical ways of 
working and processes should be directly integrated into the PMBOK® Guide. While noting 
that not all processes apply to every project all of the time, the market asserted process 
control theory to be considerably helpful in the practice of project management. Therefore, 
this edition offers 40 nonprescriptive processes that are fully embedded within the project 
management performance domains. When tailoring a project with a focus on delivering 
positive outcomes, these processes may be used as a reference as needed. 
X5.3 Sources for the Eighth Edition 
To implement the community direction for this eighth edition, the volunteer development team 
referenced a broad range of resources, ranging from academic literature to multiple PMI standards 
and practice guides. 
Of all the sources, the PMBOK® Guide—Seventh Edition (2021) and Process Groups: A Practice 
Guide (2022) served as the primary reference points for historical project management concepts. 
Figure X5-1 illustrates the migration and synthesis of content from those primary sources to the 
PMBOK® Guide—Eighth Edition. A full list of the sources used in the creation of this edition can be 
found in the bibliography. 
X5.4 Refinement of Project Management Principles 
Market research and community input emphasized the importance of a principle-based standard 
for project management, as presented in the PMBOK® Guide—Seventh Edition. However, key 
improvements were recommended for consideration in this eighth edition, specifically the following: 
• 
Principles should be more actionable. Although respondents overwhelmingly agreed that 
principles serve as universal drivers of project success, practitioners also requested more

guidance on how the principles should be manifested in practice. This edition includes both 
the implications for each project management performance domain, as well as multiple 
concrete examples showing “principles in action” for each of the principles. 
•
Principles should be more focused. The inaugural listing of principles covered concepts
also presented in other sections of the seventh edition. For example, stakeholders were
emphasized in both a principle and a performance domain, and tailoring was presented
as both a principle and a dedicated section of the guide. This eighth edition undertook a
systematic review of project management principles to minimize overlap. Table X5-2 lists
the rationalization of the project management principles from the seventh edition to the
eighth edition.

Table X5-2. Refnement of Project Management Principles 
Seventh Edition Principles 
3.9 Navigate Complexity 
Eighth Edition 
Location 
Merged Principle: Adopt 
a Holistic View 
Rationale 
The interactions of a project’s organizations, 
stakeholders, and geographies represent 
a complex system. Success requires prac­
titioners to “zoom out” to see the related 
constraints and changes. 
3.5 Recognize, Evaluate, 
and Respond to System 
Interactions 
3.3 Effectively Engage With 
Stakeholders 
Merged Principle: Focus 
on Value 
+ 
Stakeholders 
Project Management 
Performance Domain 
Value is the fundamental driver of projects. 
Value exists only when stakeholders are un­
derstood and then guided through the change 
the project experiences and fosters. 
Deeper discussion of stakeholder engage­
ment is emphasized as a project management 
performance domain. 
3.4 Focus on Value 
3.11 Embrace Adaptability 
and Resiliency 
3.12 Enable Change to 
Achieve the Envisioned 
Future State 
3.8 Build Quality Into 
Refned Principle: 
Quality is a dimension that spans both outputs 
Processes and Deliverables 
Embed Quality Into 
Processes and 
Deliverables 
described in performance domains and 
outcomes. 
3.2 Create a Collaborative 
Project Team 
Refned Principle: Build 
an Empowered Culture 
Building an empowered culture involves 
the project team environment and effective 
collaboration with all stakeholders. 
3.6 Demonstrate Leadership 
Behaviors 
Merged Into Principle: 
Be an Accountable 
Leader 
Clarify which leadership behaviors drive 
project success. Intentional stewardship is 
one such behavior and relates to professional 
accountability. 
3.1 Be a Diligent, Respect­
ful, and Caring Steward 
3.7 Tailor Based on Context 
Migrated to Tailoring 
Section 
While tailoring is a key concept for project 
success, practitioners prefer it to be discussed 
through concrete management mechanics and 
examples. 
3.10 Optimize Risk 
Migrated to Risk Project 
While managing potential threats and opportu-

nities is core to project success, practitioners 
prefer it to be discussed through concrete 
mechanics, in relationship to other principles 
and performance domains.
