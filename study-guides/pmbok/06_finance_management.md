Table 2-7. Check Outcomes—Schedule Performance Domain 
Outcome 
Scheduling approaches are consis-
tent with the project deliverables. 
Check 
Align the schedule with the development approach for deliverables 
(predictive, adaptive, or hybrid). 
The project life cycle consists of pha-
ses that connect the delivery of busi-
ness and stakeholder value from the 
beginning to the end of the project. 
Represent the project work—from project launch to close—in 
project phases. Ensure the phases include the appropriate exit 
criteria. 
A holistic approach to delivering the 
project outcomes is developed. 
Select and develop a delivery schedule that demonstrates that the 
project is planned in a holistic manner with no gaps or areas of 
misalignment. 
Schedule documentation is 
complete. 
Ensure that the schedule documentation includes all essential ele-
ments, such as task dependencies, durations, resource allocations, 
and milestones, based on the development approach selected. 
Scheduling tools and techniques are 
used. 
Monitor whether the team employed appropriate scheduling tools 
(e.g., project management software) and techniques (e.g., critical 
path method) during the schedule development. 
Stakeholders are involved in the 
schedule development. 
Check the level of participation from key stakeholders (e.g., client, 
team members) during the scheduling process. Low involvement 
may lead to an unrealistic or poorly developed schedule. 
Suffcient buffers are built in for 
known-unknowns. 
Check that major project constraints and known risks are factored 
into the project schedule by providing suffcient foats, contingency 
reserves, or alternate activity network strategies such as second-
ary plans. 
2.4 Finance Performance Domain 
The Finance performance domain addresses processes and tools related to the use and allocation 
of monetary resources, both internally and externally, to the performing organization. Financial 
performance relates to the costs, funding, and, in some cases, the value proposition of the project. 
Processes described in this performance domain include planning, estimating, budgeting, financing, 
funding, managing, measuring, and controlling costs so the project can optimize value for the 
organization. 
Having timely and accurate information about project work and performance allows the project team 
to learn and determine the appropriate actions needed to address current or expected variances from 
the desired performance. Financial measures are used for multiple reasons, including the following: 
• 
Evaluating performance compared to the plan; 
• 
Tracking the utilization of resources, work completed, budget expended, etc.; 
• 
Demonstrating accountability;

• 
Providing information to stakeholders; 
• 
Forecasting future trends, including cost overruns, resource shortages, or savings; 
• 
Evaluating return on investment, long-term value, and impacts; and 
• 
Enhancing risk management to help ensure the project’s financial health and overall 
success. 
The value of financial measurements is not in the collection and dissemination of the data, but rather 
in the interactions about how to use the data to make value-adding, well-informed decisions and take 
appropriate actions. Therefore, while much of this performance domain addresses various types of 
measurements that can be captured, use of the measurements occurs within the context of activities 
in other performance domains such as project team and stakeholder discussions, coordinating 
project work, and so forth. 
2.4.1 Key Concepts 
The following key concepts support effective practices for the Finance performance domain: 
• 
Value definition. Organizations use various strategies to define value, either tangible or 
intangible, which is often based on financial returns (tangible), with metrics such as return 
on investment (ROI), internal rate of return (IRR), payback period, or return on assets (ROA) 
that can be used to measure project success and alignment with organizational goals. 
The return on average capital employed (ROACE) may also be used. The ROACE method 
can help calculate the organization’s profitability compared to the money that has been 
invested. Sometimes, other indicators can be used such as compliance with regulations 
or social impact; therefore, value may be more than just profit (financial) and can also 
be value for people (social) or the planet (environmental). As an example, sometimes 
spending more on a given project is acceptable as the value is measured by the outcome 
of the project being available on a given date. In some cases, projects do not actually 
bring value by themselves, as they may be a component of a program, where value will 
be realized in the future. On the other hand, customer satisfaction and innovation are 
examples of intangible value. 
• 
Value maximization. The Finance performance domain focuses not only on cost 
management but also on ensuring that the project delivers maximum value for the 
organization. This effort involves aligning with strategy, using clear indicators of project 
success such as ROI and IRR, and considering other dimensions like social impact, customer 
satisfaction, and innovation. 
• 
Funding. Project management practitioners should have an understanding of how a project 
acquires its financial resources. Monies can be provided by several means, including but 
not limited to internal organizational budgets, customer contracts, grants, or customer-
driven “crowdfunding.” Project practitioners are often called upon to lead or support such 
funding activities, either before or during a project. 
• 
Financial constraints. Budget is generally the primary financial constraint of a project 
but it is not the only one. Sometimes the project is restricted to the use of a given type 
of financial resource. Examples may include types of funding like capital expenditures 
(CapEx) and operational expenditures (OpEx) or internal versus external personnel, which 
may incur different budget strategies or funding that is allocated for a specific purpose 
or a specific time period such as a fiscal year. CapEx are intended funds invested by

the performing organization to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as 
property, plants, buildings, technology, or equipment. OpEx are intended funds for the 
ongoing costs of running the day-to-day business activities or operations. These expenses 
typically include advertising expenses, administration fees, wages, rent, and utility costs. 
In some cases, the total amount of OpEx can influence the financial results of the whole 
organization. In other cases, the budget is allocated annually and therefore has to be 
used within the year, with no possibility of being transferred to the next year. In projects 
that implement an agile approach, the budget can be allocated for a quarter and then 
revised quarterly. This allocation allows more flexibility in terms of budget, based on the 
amount of work achieved. 
• 
Project budget. Project budget buildup depends on organizational process assets (OPAs), 
policies, governance, portfolio practices, and financial management practices within 
the organization. The project budget can also be influenced by external regulations, 
compliance, accounting principles, or industry standards applicable to the organization, 
leading to significant variations. In one scenario, the initial project budget may contain the 
sum of approved work package cost estimates, contingency reserve, and management 
reserve, with reserves managed implicitly. In another scenario, the initial project budget 
may contain the sum of approved work cost estimates, while contingency reserve and 
management reserve are managed explicitly. Figure 2-25 illustrates the two possible budget 
buildup scenarios. However, variations may exist based on organizational preferences or 
external influences. 
• 
Cost baseline. Similar to a project budget, the cost baseline may vary depending on 
organizational preferences or external factors. The cost baseline is the approved version 
of the time-phased project budget, excluding any management reserves, which can 
be changed only through formal change control procedures and is used as a basis for 
comparison to actual results. Alternatively, the cost baseline may be the approved version 
of the time-phased initial project budget, excluding both contingency and management 
reserves, which can be changed only through formal change control procedures and is used 
as a basis for comparison to actual results. Figure 2-25 presents two possible scenarios: one 
including contingency reserve in the cost baseline (left side) and one excluding contingency 
reserve (right side). 
• 
Reserves. A reserve is a provision in the project management plan to mitigate cost and/or 
schedule risks, often used with a modifier (e.g., management reserve, contingency reserve) 
to provide further detail on what types of risk are meant to be mitigated. Contingency 
reserves and management reserves are distinct in their purpose and authority of usage 
and may differ on risk classification (known-unknowns or unknown-unknowns). For more 
information, see the Risk performance domain in Section 2.7. The contingency reserve is 
the time or money allocated in the schedule or cost baseline for known risks with active 
response strategies and is usually allocated in the initial project budget (see Figure 2-25, left 
side). However, based on different organizational preferences or external factors, it may be 
outside the initial project budget (see Figure 2-25, right side). The management reserve is 
time or money that management sets aside in addition to the schedule or cost baseline and 
releases for unforeseen work that is within the scope of the portfolio, program, or project. 
This reserve is used for unknown-unknowns rather than specific, identified risks. Typically, 
management reserves are realized at the discretion of senior leadership or management. 
However, in some organizations, it may be at the discretion of the project manager or 
project management team.

• 
Cost management. The primary source of project costs comes from the resources needed 
to complete the project activities. Every project decision may incur further costs related to 
using, maintaining, and supporting the project’s purpose to create value, emphasizing the 
need for life cycle cost and maintenance considerations. For example, limiting the number 
of design reviews could reduce the cost of the project but increase the resulting product’s 
operating costs. 
• 
Cost measurement. Different stakeholders measure project costs in different ways and 
at different times. For example, the cost of an acquired item may be measured when the 
acquisition decision is made or committed, the order is placed, the item is delivered, or the 
actual cost is incurred or recorded for project accounting purposes. In many organizations, 
predicting and analyzing the prospective financial performance of the project’s product is 
performed outside of the project. In others, such as a capital facilities project, project cost 
management should include this work. 
2.4.2 Processes 
The Finance performance domain includes the processes required to determine, manage, and 
control the finances of the project. The following processes are included in the Finance performance 
domain (see Figure 2-26): 
• 
Plan Financial Management. The process of defining how the project revenues and 
expenses will be estimated, budgeted, managed, monitored, and controlled, ensuring 
alignment with project objectives and organizational strategy. 
• 
Estimate Costs. The process of developing an approximation of the cost of resources 
needed to complete project work.

Monitor and Control Finances. The process of monitoring the project’s financial status, 
updating project finances, managing changes to the cost baseline and revenue forecasts, 
and ensuring that the project deliverables maintain their financial viability throughout the 
project life cycle. 
2.4.2.1 Plan Financial Management 
Plan Financial Management is the process of defining how the project revenues and expenses will be 
estimated, budgeted, managed, monitored, and controlled. The key benefit of this process is that it 
provides guidance and direction on how the project finances will be managed throughout the project. 
This process is performed once up front or at predefined points in the project (see Figure 2-27). 
2.4.2.2 Estimate Costs 
Estimate Costs is the process of developing an approximation of the cost of resources needed to 
complete project work. The key benefit of this process is that it determines the monetary resources 
required for the project. The process is performed periodically throughout the project as needed 
(see Figure 2-28).

2.4.2.3 Develop Budget 
Develop Budget is the process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work 
packages to establish an authorized cost baseline. The key benefit of this process is that it determines 
the cost baseline against which project performance can be monitored and controlled. This process is 
performed once or at predefined points in the project (see Figure 2-29). 
2.4.2.4 Monitor and Control Finances 
Monitor and Control Finances is the systematic process of overseeing and managing a project’s 
financial health by continuously tracking expenditures, updating financial records, adjusting the cost 
baseline and revenue forecasts as needed, and implementing corrective actions to address financial 
risks. This effort ensures that the project remains financially viable and aligned with budgetary goals 
throughout its entire life cycle. Financial monitoring also includes variance analysis—comparing actual 
costs against planned costs to identify and address deviations. The key benefit of this process is that 
the cost baseline is maintained throughout the project, as well as any anticipated revenue or cost 
savings projections associated with project outcomes. This process enables proactive decision-making

to address deviations, optimize resource allocations, and ensure alignment with financial goals. The 
Monitor and Control Finances process is performed throughout the project, ensuring that costs 
remain under control and that the project is realizing financial benefits, if relevant (see Figure 2-30). 
2.4.3 Tailoring Considerations 
Because each project is unique, activities and processes in the Finance performance domain should 
be tailored. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
Product. Heavily regulated industries may require a more formal set of controls related to 
finance, like compliance with standards such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) or General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) to ensure financial data integrity and security. Examples include 
financial or pharmaceutical industries, where multiphase project processes are common and 
may impact the way finances are planned and tracked along the project life cycle. 
• 
Development approach. Iterative approaches impact the project expenditures, 
flattening the spent curve throughout the project. Both financial planning and controls 
should be tailored accordingly. For iterative projects, cost management practices, such 
as time-phased budgeting and continuous funding assessment, are employed to manage 
evolving project needs.

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
• 
Procurement strategy. Make-or-buy decisions are connected to the procurement strategy. 
For buy decisions, procurement tailoring involves selecting the appropriate contract type, 
such as fixed-price or time and materials (T&M) contracts, based on risk distribution and 
cost certainty, which may have multiple implications for the financial side of the project. It is 
important to tailor the financial processes with the procurement strategy to minimize the risk 
of cost overruns. Sometimes organizations make a buy decision to outsource if they do not 
have the in-house infrastructure or technologies needed to internally complete the project. 
• 
Value definition. The definition of value may vary from one performing organization to 
another. 
• 
Resource availability. Constraints in human resources, as well as physical or virtual 
resources, may increase a project’s actual and forecasted costs due to higher wages or 
training costs, expedited shipping fees, rental surcharges, additional labor costs, overhead, 
or penalties for late delivery. See Section 2.6 on the Resources performance domain and 
enterprise environmental factors (EEFs). 
2.4.3.1 Examples 
The following are three examples of how these considerations might be applied: 
• 
Example 1. A project with an adaptive life cycle may require frequent adjustments to the 
contract and budget. Thus, contracts should be structured in a way that reflects budget 
expenditures in alignment with the iterative progress and cadence of the project. 
• 
Example 2. A small project may have limited financial flexibility. Thus, a conservative 
approach to budgeting with contingency and management reserves is crucial to mitigate 
risks and ensure project stability. 
• 
Example 3. A project in the government sector may have a higher demand for fiscal 
accountability and risk aversion, due to public accountability and regulatory requirements. 
Thus, budget reserves should be evaluated with a greater buffer to account for potential 
risks and uncertainties, ensuring that the project can handle any unforeseen financial 
challenges without compromising its objectives. This effort is influenced by the sponsor and 
stakeholders, who may prioritize maintaining a higher buffer to mitigate risks. 
2.4.4 Interactions With Other Domains 
Finance is one of the key pillars of a successful project as it provides access to the resources necessary 
for its proper execution. In that sense, financial resources and constraints have a direct impact on the 
Governance, Scope, and Schedule performance domains. The decisions made in those performance 
domains may affect the Finance performance domain, just as financial activities may affect the other 
domains. Additionally, the Finance performance domain may be impacted by other performance 
domains, such as Stakeholders and Risk. On a broader scale, maximizing value delivery should be the 
primary goal of a project, connecting its results to the performing organization’s strategy. 
2.4.5 Check Results 
Activities related to the Finance performance domain should be considered successful only if they 
contribute to specific outcomes. Table 2-8 shows a set of sample target outcomes, along with a 
potential check to confirm whether those outcomes are met.
