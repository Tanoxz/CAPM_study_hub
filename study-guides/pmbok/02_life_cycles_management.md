Introduction
The Standard for Project Management identifies project management principles that guide behaviours 
and actions of project professionals and other stakeholders who work on or are engaged with 
projects.
This introductory section describes the purpose of this standard, defines key terms and concepts, 
and id ntifies the audience for the standard.
The Standard for Project Management consists of the following sections:

Project Life Cycles 
A project life cycle is the series of activities and/or phases that a project passes through from its start 
to its closure. The project life cycle provides the foundational framework for managing a project. 
This basic framework applies regardless of the specific project work involved or the adopted project 
development approach. 
This section explores the project life cycle through five factors: 
• 
Project phases, 
• 
Project development approaches (predictive, adaptive, hybrid), 
• 
Considerations for selecting a development approach, 
• 
Delivery cadence, and 
• 
Project Management Focus Areas (formerly known as Process Groups). 
4.1 Project Phases 
Projects are often decomposed into multiple phases. A project phase is a collection of logically related 
project activities that culminates in the completion of one or more deliverables and/or outcomes. 
The phases may be sequential, transitional, or overlapping. In some projects a combination of these 
phases may be used, and each phase may include one or more stages of the project life cycle. Project

life cycles are independent of product life cycles, which can be part of the outcomes produced by a 
project. Projects may also generate outputs, which in turn enable outcomes that progressively realize 
the organization’s strategy. 
The phases in a life cycle can be described by a variety of attributes. Attributes may be measurable 
and unique to a specific phase. Attributes may include but are not limited to name, number, duration, 
resource requirements, entrance criteria for a project to move into that phase, and exit criteria for a 
project to complete a phase. A phase gate may occur after the end of a phase, before the beginning 
of the next phase. 
Phase gates often include a review—sometimes known as stage gate, gate review, iteration review, 
or decision point review—to check that the desired outcomes or exit criteria for the phase have 
been achieved before proceeding to the next phase. Exit criteria may be tied to acceptance criteria 
for deliverables, contractual obligations, meeting specific performance targets, or other tangible 
measures. Factors such as resource availability, verification of the project’s viability, and current 
alignment with organizational goals may determine the entry criteria. The project’s performance and 
progress are compared to project and business documents that specify expectations. A decision (e.g., 
go/no-go decision) is made as a result of this comparison to continue to the next phase, continue to 
the next phase with modification, end the project or phase, remain in the phase, repeat the phase or 
elements of it, or park the project temporarily to address another urgent business initiative. 
While phase gates are traditionally placed at the end of each phase to review the project’s progress, 
they can also be placed at the start of each phase. These starting phase gates (pre-phase gates) 
can help ensure that the project is properly aligned, that sufficient resources and planning are in 
place, and that potential risks are addressed before progressing further. This additional checkpoint 
enhances the control and success of the project. 
Organizations with multiple projects will often adopt a few standard project life cycles. Project 
managers and project teams may need to advise their management on the most appropriate life 
cycle to use, or it may be prescribed for them. If there is no standard life cycle, project managers and 
project teams should determine the best life cycle for each project. The project life cycle should be 
flexible enough to meet or exceed the project’s target objectives in a way that protects and enhances 
the project’s value proposition as much as possible. Life cycle flexibility often includes the following: 
• 
Selecting the development approach or mix of approaches; 
• 
Identifying the types of processes and activities that should be performed; and 
• 
Adjusting the various attributes of an activity, phase, or process (e.g., name, duration, 
entrance criteria, and exit criteria). 
A generic project phase is generally impacted by a series of characteristics. Depending on the project 
life cycle, these may present a series of scenarios. These characteristics and their scenarios vary 
greatly but may include the following: 
• 
Cost and staffing. In many predictive project scenarios, levels of cost and staffing are low at 
the start, increase as the work is carried out, and drop rapidly as the project or phase ends. 
• 
Risk and uncertainty. Regardless of the project life cycle, these two elements are usually 
greatest at the start of the project or phase and decrease over the project’s life cycle as 
decisions are reached and deliverables are accepted.

• 
Stakeholder influence on change. In some scenarios, the ability of stakeholders to 
influence the project’s scope—increasing value without significantly impacting cost and 
schedule—is highest at the start of the project or phase and decreases as the project 
progresses toward completion. In other cases, stakeholders are encouraged to participate 
actively in the execution process, ensuring that value has been delivered according to 
their expectations and the organization’s best interest. Consistent feedback leads to the 
possibility of detecting risks and their impacts at an earlier stage (see Figure 4-1). 
4.2 Project Development Approaches 
A development approach is the means used to create and evolve a product, service, or result 
during the project life cycle. Note that the term “development approach” is separate from the term 
“development phase of the project.” The development approach refers to the method used to create 
and evolve the product, service, or result during the project life cycle, such as predictive, adaptive, or 
hybrid methods. The development approach defines how the project will be managed and executed. 
Conversely, the development phase of the project is a specific stage within the project life cycle 
where both the actual creation and testing of deliverables occur. This stage involves detailed work to 
produce the project’s outputs. There are different development approaches, and different industries 
may use different terms to refer to them. 
Three commonly used approaches are predictive, adaptive, and hybrid. These approaches are often 
viewed as a spectrum, from the predictive approach on one end of the spectrum to the adaptive 
approach on the other end. The hybrid approach is usually intended as a mix of predictive and 
adaptive approaches (see Figure 4-2).

Figure 4-2. The Spectrum of Development Approaches 
The choice of the development approach for a project is typically made by the project manager 
in consultation with the project management team, who, based on the nature of the project, 
carries out the necessary evaluations for establishing the framework and way of working with 
the team. 
The main factors that play a role in the choice of the approach are related to the requirements, 
scope, timeline, and goals of the project; the organization’s culture and needs; and the level of 
stakeholder involvement, risk profile, technological considerations, and overall complexity of the 
broader project context. 
When the requirements are sufficiently clear and stable early in the project, a predictive approach 
may be optimal and, in this setup, the schedule baseline, together with the cost baseline, are 
determined according to the scope that should be delivered. Taken together, the baselines for 
schedule, cost, and scope are referred to as the project’s integrated baseline. 
When the requirements are less clear early in the project, or the project is expected to incur more 
complexity and uncertainty, then more feedback is needed (e.g., details from the final customer 
or end user) to ensure project success. In such cases, an adaptive approach may be optimal. In an 
adaptive approach, work is reviewed periodically, often in a timeboxed cadence, so that feedback 
can be incorporated as the integrated baseline evolves. At the end of the timebox, the requirements 
that have been implemented will be reviewed and planning for the next timebox will commence. In 
this case, based on the timeboxes and the team involved (as well as the budget), the scope will be 
delivered in an adaptive way. 
However, it is important to note that differing possible adaptive approaches may provide different 
possible sets of project baselines. Projects often need the ability to vary a set of constraints in 
order to operate with other, more fixed constraints, often called the inverted triangle concept 
(see Figure 4-3).

4.2.1 Predictive Approaches 
A predictive approach may be optimal when the project scope can be stabilized early in the project. A 
predictive approach may also be referred to as a waterfall, plan-driven, or traditional approach. This 
approach is also suitable for large projects involving significant investment or regulatory oversight. 
These conditions may require robust change control mechanisms and planned reevaluation between 
successive phases. The scope, schedule, cost, resource needs, quality requirements, and risks can be 
well defined in the early phases of the project life cycle and are expected to remain relatively stable. 
This development approach allows the project team to capture reliable certainty early in the project 
and to perform much of the planning up front (see Figure 4-4). 
For projects or phases in which the cost of iterating far exceeds its value, such as the build phase 
of many construction projects, a predictive approach may be optimal. Similarly, for projects in 
heavily regulated environments, such as healthcare, there may be phase gates required in order 
for regulators to carefully assess whether, for instance, a new drug treatment or medical device has 
demonstrated sufficient promise to merit further development. 
In certain predictive approaches, it may be optimal to deliver the product partially and incrementally, 
rather than as a single, final release. An incremental approach is used when the overall scope is well 
understood and planned up front, but phased delivery offers advantages due to the size, complexity, 
or specific risk factors of the project environment. In this approach, the project is divided into 
different phases or increments, with each phase or increment delivering a part of the overall product. 
Each increment builds upon the previous one, progressively adding features and functionality or 
completing parts of the product (see Figure 4-5). The increments may be sequential or overlap and 
the phases in each increment may differ, depending on the nature of the work. While stakeholder 
value is realized earlier through partial delivery, the overall scope and timeline remain largely fixed. 
This approach allows stakeholders to use and benefit from parts of the product before the entire 
project is completed and can often enhance the value proposition of the project while still adhering 
to the predictive framework of structured planning and controlled change management.

4.2.2 Adaptive Approaches 
Also referred to as change-driven or agile approaches, adaptive approaches are useful when a 
project’s requirements and technical solution are subject to a high level of uncertainty and volatility 
and are likely to change significantly throughout the project. A clear vision is established at the 
start of the project, and the initial known requirements are progressively elaborated, changed, or 
replaced in accordance with stakeholder feedback, the environment, or unexpected events. Adaptive 
approaches can be both iterative and incremental. The iterative approach focuses on refining and 
improving the project through repeated cycles (iterations). The incremental approach delivers the 
final product in small, usable segments (increments), where the increments each provide value and 
build on one another until the complete product is delivered. 
While agility is a wide mindset that is broader than a development framework, agile approaches 
can be considered adaptive. Some agile methods entail iterations that are generally 1 to 4 weeks 
in duration, with a demonstration of the accomplishments at the end of each iteration. The entire 
project team is heavily involved in the planning at various levels. In the iteration, the team members 
determine the scope they can achieve based on the prioritized requirements in the form of the 
product backlog, estimate the amount of work, and work collaboratively to develop the scope during 
the iteration (see Figure 4-6). 
Several adaptive methodologies use flow-based scheduling. Flow-based scheduling is a project 
management approach that focuses on optimizing the flow of work through a system. One goal is to 
maximize the flow of deliverables based on resource capacity, materials, and other inputs. A related goal 
is to minimize time and resource waste and maximize the efficiency of processes and the throughput of 
deliverables. Projects that use these practices and techniques often adopt them from flow-maximizing 
approaches such as the Kanban method (a visual workflow management method to limit work in 
process [WIP] based on lean principles and focusing on continuous delivery without overburdening 
the team) and the theory of constraints (a management philosophy that focuses on identifying and 
addressing the most significant limiting factor [constraint] that stands in the way of achieving a goal).

The Standard for Project Management
 
It is useful to distinguish between agile methods designed for a single team versus those designed 
for larger-scale purposes. Some methods feature more breadth of coverage (how much of the project 
or product life cycle the approach covers), whereas others feature more depth of coverage (how 
detailed or prescriptive the guidance is). Figure 4-7 provides examples of agile methods that may be 
considered. 
There is also a meaningful difference between larger-scale methods and larger-scale tool kits. A 
method is a systematic way of doing something, typically involving a series of steps or procedures 
designed to achieve a specific outcome. As such, methods provide structured approaches to 
problem-solving or task completion. 
Conversely, a tool kit is a collection of tools, techniques, and resources that can be used to support 
various methods or approaches. A tool kit provides flexibility and a range of options to choose from 
based on the context and specific needs of a project or task. 
PMI Disciplined Agile® (DA®) [3] is designed to be a tool kit. 
Adaptive approaches may be well suited for the following specific types of projects: 
• 
Design projects. Adaptive approaches are appropriate for design or new product 
development projects, where requirements are not fully defined up front and where partial 
deliveries and changes are expected during the project.

• 
New product development. Adaptive approaches are also appropriate for projects 
where the final features of the product are refined based on market needs such as the 
development of a new mobile app or web service. 
• 
Digital projects. Adaptive approaches are popular with software projects due to their 
dynamic nature. While not all software development projects require an adaptive approach, 
those with evolving scope, high uncertainty, and the need for early or incremental delivery 
are strong candidates for this approach. 
4.2.3 Hybrid Approaches 
A hybrid development approach is a combination of adaptive and predictive approaches. This 
development approach incorporates some elements from a predictive approach and some from an 
adaptive approach. This development approach might be appropriate when there is uncertainty or 
risk around the requirements such as the design of a custom home. Once the design is complete, 
it makes sense to iterate no more than once for the build. Hybrid approaches are also useful when 
deliverables can be modularized or when there are deliverables that can be developed by different 
project teams. 
In practice, most projects can strongly benefit from a hybrid approach that combines adaptive and 
predictive methodologies. Focusing exclusively on either an adaptive or predictive approach does 
not fully address the varied challenges and complexities that modern projects present. A hybrid 
approach provides flexibility to adapt to changing conditions while retaining control over predictable 
aspects. 
Another example is a project with two main deliverables, where one deliverable is developed using 
an adaptive approach and the other using a predictive approach (e.g., software that will be developed 
with an adaptive approach but needs to be installed in a new data center that will be built with a 
predictive approach). 
With a hybrid approach, the various phases of the project can be approached differently. Projects 
can primarily be carried out using one approach while subsidiary streams can use a different way of 
working—in certain cases, adaptive, and in other cases, predictive. 
Hybrid project management methods follow four common patterns, as illustrated in Figures 4-8 
through 4-11. 
• 
The early processes use an adaptive development life cycle, which is then followed by a 
predictive rollout phase.

• 
Another approach is to use a combination of adaptive and predictive approaches 
throughout the life cycle. 
• 
A small adaptive element within a primarily predictive project is used. 
• 
A largely adaptive approach with a predictive component is used. 
Some examples where a hybrid approach may be suitable include the following: 
• 
Construction project with IT integration. A hybrid approach is appropriate during a 
construction project (predictive) that involves building a smart building with complex IT 
systems that need to be flexible during development (adaptive). 
• 
Healthcare solutions. A hybrid approach is also appropriate during the implementation 
of an electronic medical records system in a hospital where certain aspects (infrastructure 
setup) are predictive but the development and integration of the user interface may benefit 
from an adaptive approach. 
The PMI Disciplined Agile® (DA®) tool kit [4] describes three levels of hybrid approaches commonly 
found in projects across industries: 
• 
Hybrid Level 1. A predictive approach is the dominant contributor to the way of working. 
Meanwhile, some adaptive elements are leveraged to reduce specific project pain points. 
• 
Hybrid Level 2. At this level, both the predictive and adaptive approaches contribute 
significantly to the success of a project. 
• 
Hybrid Level 3. At this point on the spectrum, an adaptive approach becomes the major 
contributor to the way of working. Some predictive elements are used to satisfy various 
business constraints. 
Today, most projects require a hybrid approach, combining elements of both adaptive and predictive 
methodologies. Relying solely on one approach—whether adaptive or predictive—is no longer 
sufficient to address the diverse challenges and complexities that modern projects present. A hybrid 
approach allows for greater flexibility, enabling project teams to adapt to changing conditions while 
still maintaining control over predictable aspects of the project.

4.3 Considerations for a Development Approach Selection 
There are several factors that influence the selection of a development approach. The factors can 
be divided into categories of the deliverables, the project, and the organization. The following 
subsections describe the variables associated with each category. The diversity of factors often 
implies that several development approaches may be used within the same projects for different 
deliverables. 
4.3.1 Deliverables 
There are many variables associated with project deliverables that can influence the choice of 
development approach. The following list outlines some of the variables to consider when selecting 
the development approach: 
• 
Degree of innovation. When new or complex technological and/or business model 
innovation is needed, an adaptive approach may be optimal. 
• 
Requirements certainty. When the requirements are well known and straightforward to 
define, a predictive approach may be optimal. 
• 
Degree of scope stability. This variable refers to the degree to which the project scope is 
stable throughout the project execution. In general, the less stable the scope is, the more 
optimal it will be to apply an adaptive approach. 
• 
Ease of change. If the nature of the deliverable makes it difficult or costly to manage and 
incorporate changes, then a predictive approach may be optimal. 
• 
Delivery options. The nature of the deliverables and whether they can be delivered in 
components or progressively elaborated can influence the development approach. More 
details can be found in Section 4.4 on delivery cadence. 
• 
Risk. Adaptive approaches may be helpful to manage risk and uncertainty. 
• 
Safety requirements. Products that have rigorous safety requirements often use a 
predictive approach as there is a need for significant up-front planning to ensure safety 
compliance. 
• 
Feedback. If there is significant value likely to be realized from frequent feedback from the 
end users and stakeholders, an adaptive approach may be optimal. 
• 
Regulations. Environments that have significant regulatory oversight may use a predictive 
approach due to the required processes, documentation, and demonstration needs.

The Standard for Project Management
 
4.3.2 Project 
Project variables that influence the choice of development approach may include the following: 
• 
Stakeholders. Projects that use adaptive methods typically call for significant stakeholder 
involvement throughout the process. 
• 
Schedule constraints. If there is value to be realized from delivering something early, even 
if it is not a finished product, an iterative or adaptive approach may be optimal. Meanwhile, 
when a fixed end date must be met, a predictive approach can help focus planning on 
delivery timelines. 
• 
Financing uncertainty. Projects being executed in an environment of financing uncertainty 
may generate more value using an adaptive or iterative approach. 
• 
Project size and complexity. More flexible approaches are more suitable for larger, 
complex projects with evolving requirements. 
• 
Team experience and skills. Projects managed using an adaptive or agile approach may 
benefit from teams with strong communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. 
• 
Interdependencies. A reliance on other projects, departments, or functions for decisions, 
components, or resources may be a decision factor for the project team to consider for 
delivering projects with an iterative approach. 
4.3.3 Organization 
Organizational variables such as the structure, culture, capability, project team size, and location can 
influence the choice of development approach. The organizational variables to consider may include 
the following: 
• 
Organizational structure. Organizations with a fixed functional structure—and more 
traditional hierarchical arrangements—are more inclined to select a predictive approach 
due to preferred lines of authority. Organizations with a network-oriented structure may be 
more naturally inclined to embrace more adaptive or hybrid approaches. 
• 
Culture. A predictive approach may be a better fit in an organization with a culture of 
managing and directing, where the work is planned out and progress is measured against 
baselines. Adaptive approaches may fit better in an organizational culture that more easily 
embraces uncertainty while also emphasizing self-managed teams, flexible thinking, and 
innovation. 
• 
Organizational capability. Organizational policies, ways of working, reporting structures, 
and attitudes should all be aligned to employ delivery methods successfully. Additionally, 
the extent to which project management processes are established can influence the 
reliability and predictability of the chosen project delivery approach. 
• 
Project team size and location. Adaptive approaches often work better with smaller 
project teams. Some adaptive frameworks recommend having between three and nine 
team members. In predictive and hybrid approaches, this number may depend more 
on the project’s requirements and scope complexity. Team location is relevant to all 
approaches, though some adaptive methods call for the colocation of team members. For 
some individuals and teams, remote work may enhance efficiency and focus on the team’s 
execution.

4.4 Delivery Cadence 
Based on the selected development approach, projects can have a single delivery, multiple deliveries, 
periodic deliveries, or continuous deliveries. 
• 
Single delivery. Projects that have a single delivery produce all outcomes at the end of the 
project. For example, a process-reengineering project may not have any deliveries until 
near the end of the project when the new process is rolled out. 
• 
Multiple deliveries. Some projects have multiple deliveries. A project may have multiple 
components or elaborations delivered at different times throughout the project. For example, 
a project to develop a new drug may have multiple deliveries, such as preclinical submissions, 
Phase 1 clinical trial results (safety, side effects, optimal dose, and timing), Phase 2 clinical 
trial results (effectiveness for 100–300 human volunteers), Phase 3 clinical trial results 
(tests efficacy against standard treatments), registration and regulatory approval, and then 
launch. In this example, the deliveries are sequential. Some projects have deliveries that are 
developed separately rather than sequentially, such as a project to update building security, 
as many tasks can be performed in parallel. Deliveries may include physical barriers to entry, 
new badges, new key code pads, and so forth. Each of these is a separate delivery, but few, 
if any of them, need to follow a specific order. In all cases, however, the deliveries should be 
concluded in order to meet or exceed the target business objectives. 
• 
Periodic deliveries. Commonly used in adaptive approaches, periodic deliveries are like 
multiple deliveries but are on a regular and fixed delivery schedule such as monthly or 
semimonthly. A new software application may have internal deliveries every 2 weeks and 
then periodically release the deliveries into the market. 
• 
Continuous delivery. Continuous delivery is the practice of incrementally delivering 
value to production on an ongoing basis. This approach focuses on delivering tested and 
validated product increments, ensuring they are production-ready at all times. By leveraging 
automation and maintaining a continuous flow from backlog prioritization through iterative 
development and testing, teams can deploy frequently and efficiently while minimizing 
risks. Continuous delivery fosters responsiveness to customer feedback and evolving 
market trends, allowing organizations to iterate quickly and provide regular updates without 
introducing unnecessary deployment overheads. 
4.5 Project Management Focus Areas 
This standard describes the fundamental actions that take place over the course of any project, 
regardless of whether the project follows a predictive, adaptive, or hybrid approach. These project 
management actions are grouped into five Project Management Focus Areas: 
• 
Initiating, 
• 
Planning, 
• 
Executing, 
• 
Monitoring and Controlling, and 
• 
Closing. 
These Focus Areas are implemented using formal processes, informal practices, or other policies, 
procedures, or techniques. The areas can involve iterative, continuous, and/or overlapping actions 
that are performed when planned or needed during the project and/or in each phase of the project.

The Standard for Project Management
 
 
 
While these Focus Areas are presented sequentially, in practice they often overlap and interact 
dynamically throughout the project life cycle. 
The Project Management Focus Areas should not be confused with project phases, although some 
naming conventions may be the same or a project phase may largely consist of activities that are part 
of a Focus Area. 
Additionally, these Focus Areas intersect with project management performance domains in specific 
ways. Detailed descriptions of the project management performance domains and their relationships to 
the Focus Areas are provided in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) [2]. 
4.5.1 Initiating Focus Area 
The Initiating Focus Area consists of those processes, practices, or actions performed to define a new 
project or new phase of an existing project. This area often includes formal authorization to start the 
project or phase. The purpose of the Initiating Focus Area is to align the stakeholders’ expectations 
and the project’s purpose, inform stakeholders of the scope and objectives, align key stakeholders, 
and discuss how their participation in the project and its associated phases can help to ensure their 
expectations are met. 
Among the various initiating actions, the initial scope is defined and initial financial resources are 
committed. Stakeholders who will interact and influence the overall outcome of the project are 
identified and project management roles are assigned. This information is often captured in artifacts 
such as a project charter or stakeholder register. 
The key benefits of this Focus Area are that projects are only authorized when aligned with the 
organization’s strategic objectives and when the business case, benefits, and stakeholders are 
considered from the start of the project. In some organizations, a project manager is involved in 
developing the business case and defining the benefits. In other organizations, a broader project 
management team helps write a formal project charter, while others have the preliminary project work 
done by the project sponsor, PMO, portfolio steering committee, or another stakeholder group. 
Business documents are those documents that generally originate outside of the project but are used 
as inputs to the project. Examples of business documents include the business case and benefits 
management plan. Figure 4-12 shows one way a sponsor and related business documents may relate 
to initiating actions. 
In the business documents, the sponsor should provide the minimum information necessary for a 
project manager to start project activities. Involving the sponsors, customers, and other stakeholders 
during project initiation creates a shared understanding of success criteria. This involvement also 
increases alignment on project deliverables as well as stakeholder satisfaction throughout the project. 
4.5.2 Planning Focus Area 
The Planning Focus Area consists of those processes, practices, or actions that establish the intended 
scope of the effort, define and refine the objectives, and develop the course of action required to 
attain those objectives. Such activities may involve developing several artifacts such as a product 
backlog or a project management plan. 
The nature of a project may require the use of repeated feedback loops for additional analysis. As 
more project information or characteristics are gathered and understood, some additional planning

may be required. In this context, planning can follow a progressive, iterative, or rolling wave approach 
according to the project phase or life cycle approach. 
Moreover, as project changes are encountered, update planning may be required at any appropriate 
moment of a project phase. This ongoing refinement of the project management plan is called 
progressive elaboration, indicating that planning is an iterative or ongoing activity. Highly predictive 
approaches tend to front-load their planning, although plan updates and refinements throughout the 
project life cycle are not uncommon. In contrast, highly iterative approaches tend to perform some 
brief, high-level planning up front—sometimes called “roadmapping”—typically followed by a more 
consistent level of frequent planning and replanning throughout the project life cycle. 
The key benefit of this Focus Area is to define the course of action for successfully completing the 
project or phase. 
When the initial planning effort is complete, the collection of knowledge and artifacts describing the 
course of action is often referred to as the project management plan. In some organizations, that 
plan is submitted for formal approval and used as the authoritative reference for how the project will 
be managed. 
Once the project management team is oriented to—and confident with—the course of action, they 
are ready to begin executing.2 
2 Note that many project teams consider a simple, high-level roadmapping exercise as suficient 
for the initial planning, especially in environments where the scope is expected to change 
signifcantly. As a result, the project team may consider a robust analysis of scope/schedule/ 
cost trade-ofs to be efectively useless; however, some discussion on how sensitive the project’s 
value proposition is to schedule durations or specifc dates can often be crucial, as can any 
sensitivity to exceeding an investment–cost threshold.

The Standard for Project Management
4.5.3 Executing Focus Area 
The Executing Focus Area consists of those processes, practices, or actions performed to complete 
the work in a manner consistent with the currently agreed-upon course of action. 
The actions in this Focus Area include coordinating resources, managing stakeholder engagement, 
and performing the activities of the project, as well as other project tasks. The key benefit of this 
Focus Area is to drive focused execution to achieve the value proposition represented by the 
integrated baseline. The project management plan can and should be changed whenever such a 
change would enhance the value proposition of the project. This Focus Area is also where the choice 
of development approach (adaptive, predictive, or hybrid) is often most evident. 
4.5.4 Monitoring and Controlling Focus Area 
The Monitoring and Controlling Focus Area consists of those actions required to track, measure, 
review, and regulate the progress and performance of the project; identify any areas in which 
changes to the plan are required; and initiate the corresponding changes. 
Monitoring can include comparing project performance data, producing performance measures, 
comparing actual performance with planned performance, or reporting and disseminating 
performance information. Controlling can include analyzing variances, assessing trends to affect 
process improvements, evaluating possible alternatives, and recommending appropriate course 
corrections as needed. 
The key benefit of this Focus Area is to ensure the project is on track to meet expectations. This 
effort often involves measuring and analyzing project performance at regular intervals, appropriate 
events, or when exceptional conditions occur. If any variances are found, the project management 
team identifies what, if any, corrective actions may be needed. Those corrective actions are then 
negotiated and agreed upon by appropriate stakeholders. 
For any project having a stable project management plan, the effort required to perform Monitoring 
and Controlling will be fairly consistent throughout execution. In contrast, for any project undergoing 
frequent and significant changes—as is common with adaptive approaches—Monitoring and 
Controlling efforts are likely to be less consistent. 
The Monitoring and Controlling Focus Area monitors and controls the work being done within 
each life cycle phase and for the project as a whole. The Monitoring and Controlling Focus Area is 
performed in parallel with the other Focus Areas. It is not a separate, stand-alone area. 
4.5.5 Closing Focus Area 
The Closing Focus Area consists of the actions performed to formally complete or close a project, 
phase, contract, or in some cases, to terminate a project before completion. This effort may include 
the verification that specific actions are completed for other Focus Areas before a given project or 
phase can be declared as complete. 
The key benefit of this Focus Area is that phases, projects, and contracts are closed out appropriately, 
transitioning to operations in a manner that helps meet or exceed the project’s target business 
objectives. Verifying the achievement of project outputs, outcomes, and benefits as part of this 
Focus Area is essential to ensuring that the project has met or exceeded the intended value and 
stakeholders’ expectations.

This Focus Area may also address the suspension or early closure of the project (e.g., when canceling 
the project becomes the best way to maximize the return on that project investment—or perhaps 
more accurately, to minimize what may have become a negative return). 
4.5.6 Focus Areas as a Whole 
These five Focus Areas are independent of the application areas (such as marketing, information 
services, or accounting) or industry focus (such as construction, aerospace, or telecommunications). 
The Focus Areas are also independent of approach, as all development approaches honor these five 
in some manner. Individual processes, practices, or actions in the Focus Areas are often iterated prior 
to completing a phase or a project. 
The Project Management Focus Areas are essential for understanding and applying project 
management principles, regardless of the development approach (predictive, adaptive, or hybrid). 
Tailoring these areas to each project’s specific needs can ensure effective planning, execution, and 
monitoring and controlling, aligning with organizational goals and stakeholder expectations. 
Focus Areas are not project phases. If the project is divided into phases, the actions in the Focus 
Areas interact within each phase. Moreover, these five Focus Areas are not strictly sequential; 
they often overlap within a single phase. For example, planning and monitoring can happen 
simultaneously. This overlap is shown in Figures 4-13 and 4-14, which each illustrate how different 
aspects of project management may interact throughout the project life cycle. 
Figure 4-13 illustrates an example of how Focus Areas can interact during a project or phase using a 
primarily predictive approach. The level of effort applied to a given Focus Area can vary both within 
project phases and across the overall project life cycle.

Figure 4-14. Example of Focus Area Interactions Within a Project or Phase Using an 
Adaptive Approach 
Figure 4-14 illustrates an example of how Focus Areas can interact during a project or phase using 
a primarily adaptive approach. In adaptive development, the Focus Areas—Initiating, Planning, 
Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing—are not strictly linear, sequential, or performed 
all at once. Instead, they interact within short iterations in a flexible and often overlapping manner. 
Each Focus Area is revisited regularly throughout the project, allowing for continuous refinement and 
adjustment based on real-time data, feedback, and evolving project needs. This iterative approach 
enables greater responsiveness to change and helps ensure that the project remains aligned with 
stakeholder expectations and goals.

Tools and Techniques. This section presents a brief description of the tools and techniques 
listed for project management activities and the processes presented throughout the project 
management performance domains. The elements listed in this section are neither intended 
to be comprehensive, nor required for any given project. Rather, they are offered as commonly 
used selections from among the countless options that project teams have available. 
1.2 Relationship of the PMBOK® Guide and The Standard for Project Management 
Work in the project management performance domains is guided by the principles of project 
management. As described in The Standard for Project Management [1], a principle is a fundamental 
norm, truth, or value that gives guidance for the project manager and project team. The principles of 
project management provide guidance for the mindset and behavior of people involved in projects 
as they influence and shape the performance domains to produce the intended outcomes. While 
there is conceptual overlap between the principles and the performance domains, the principles 
guide mindset and behavior, while the performance domains present broad areas of focus in 
which to demonstrate that mindset and behavior. Figure 1-1 shows how the project management 
principles create a foundation for the performance domains, providing guidance to processes in each 
performance domain.

1.3 Changes to the PMBOK® Guide 
This edition of the PMBOK® Guide focuses on delivering outcomes regardless of the approach used by 
the project team. However, project practitioners using the PMBOK®  Guide also benefit from some level 
of understanding of how to deliver projects. 
This eighth edition takes the best parts of previous editions of the PMBOK® Guide to offer project 
managers a more practical and complete framework. The detailed, process-oriented approach of 
the sixth edition (using inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs [ITTOs]) is combined with the 
seventh edition’s valuable concept of performance domains, which emphasizes how different project 
elements are interconnected. This edition integrates ITTOs and process descriptions directly into the 
performance domain structure. This combined approach provides both a thorough understanding 
of individual processes and a broader view of how those processes interact to produce the desired 
project results. This approach makes the guide more adaptable and useful for project managers 
using a variety of approaches and working in diverse situations. 
Tailoring is the deliberate adaptation of the project management approach, governance, and 
processes to make them more suitable for a given environment (environmental factors include 
industry, culture, regulations, etc.) and fit for the purpose of the work at hand. The tailoring process 
is driven by the guiding project management principles, organizational values, and organizational 
culture. This guide preserves tailoring guidance from the previous edition while also adding tailoring 
considerations for each project management performance domain. 
In embracing the full spectrum of project management approaches, this edition of the PMBOK® Guide 
recognizes that no publication can capture every tool, technique, process, or practice that project teams 
might use. Therefore, this edition presents an array of commonly used good practices, activities, and 
processes that project practitioners can use to accomplish their work. These practices and processes 
are able to fit most projects most of the time.

Section 1
Project Management 
Performance Domains 
A project management performance domain is a group of related processes that are critical for the 
effective delivery of project value. These performance domains are interactive, interrelated, and 
interdependent areas of focus that work in unison to achieve the desired project results. There are 
seven project management performance domains presented in this guide, without specific weighting 
or order: 
• 
Governance, 
• 
Scope, 
•
Schedule,
• 
Finance, 
• 
Stakeholders, 
• 
Resources, and 
•
Risk.
The project management performance domains work together as a cohesive whole. In this way, they 
operate as an integrated system, with each performance domain being interdependent with the 
others to enable successful delivery of the project and its intended outcomes.

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
Performance domains run concurrently throughout the project life cycle, regardless of how value 
is delivered (frequently, periodically, or at the end of the project). For example, project leaders are 
focused on stakeholders, schedules, and so forth, from the project’s outset to its closure. These 
areas of focus are not addressed as siloed efforts because they overlap and interconnect. The ways 
in which the performance domains relate are different for each project environment, but they are 
always present. 
Each performance domain is presented with the following primary subsections: 
• 
Key Concepts—Performance domains encompass a broad discipline of methods and 
approaches. This broadness often creates a challenge regarding where project leaders 
should begin and what they should do next. Each of the performance domains begins with 
a treatise of the most important ideas, considerations, and concepts for its area. These 
concepts are often the first discussions for project management efforts and inform the 
decisions regarding when and how performance domain activities should be practiced. 
• 
Processes—The project management activities in each performance domain can be 
described in various ways such as formal policies and informal procedures. Regardless of 
how teams and organizations define their project management activities, it is helpful to 
review the industry’s common practices for a given domain. 
Accordingly, this guide presents 40 processes to describe the underlying mechanics of performance 
domain activities. Each process lists a sampling of inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs. 
Given the diversity of project management practice in today’s industry, these processes and their 
associated lists are illustrative but not comprehensive. Instead, they offer a technical description of 
project management and are not intended as a prescriptive framework or methodology. 
Several artifacts and approaches are used in multiple processes. Therefore, this section focuses on 
how inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs are leveraged in the context of a given performance 
domain. Further technical details of those elements are captured in Section 4, Inputs and Outputs, 
and Section 5, Tools and Techniques. 
The performance domain processes are listed in Table 2-1, along with their relationships to the 
Project Management Focus Areas: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and 
Closing. 
• 
Tailoring Considerations—Since all projects are executed in a unique environment, 
project management activities should be adjusted to fit the characteristics and environment 
of a given project. In addition to the formal guidance in the project tailoring section, each 
performance domain offers areas to review. Tailoring considerations should be applied 
to the corresponding project management activities to ensure alignment with the project 
objectives, even if those activities are defined per policies, practices, or procedures. 
• 
Interactions With Other Domains—While all seven performance domains are interrelated 
with one another, the specific connections among them are also important. Accordingly, 
each performance domain highlights overlaps, dependencies, or relationships that 
practitioners should consider. 
• 
Check Results—Project success requires a focus on value delivery, emphasizing 
meaningful outcomes over just outputs. Project management activities do not provide value 
by themselves. Rather, they are performed with the intent of delivering and maximizing
