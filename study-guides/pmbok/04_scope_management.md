• 
Example 2. A project that requires rapid innovation and approaches may want to adopt a 
faster feedback cycle that an agile framework may provide. Thus, a self-governing approach 
may be adopted, where there is no external governance body and the team manages all 
value delivery, outputs, quality, etc., through typical agile processes. 
• 
Example 3. A large, multinational project may require compliance with a variety of 
regulations across agencies and countries. Thus, project governance should integrate 
across domains to ensure that work on a project is appropriately monitored and controlled 
to comply with internal and external standards. Some multinational compliance may have 
regional variations that should be managed with program- or portfolio-level governance. 
2.1.8 Interactions With Other Domains 
The Governance performance domain is interrelated with all other project management performance 
domains. This interrelationship includes ensuring the alignment of project scope, schedule, and 
financial resources to maximize value delivery while balancing trade-offs. As such, Table 2-4 addresses 
interactions with the Scope, Schedule, and Finance performance domains, first and foremost. 
2.1.9 Check Results 
Acknowledging and implementing the appropriate level of project management governance requires 
a delicate balance that is tailored to the industry, organizational structure, and specific project 
context. Governance approaches should be contemplated by various stakeholders (from executives 
to project management office leaders as well as agile practitioners to other project team members) 
to ensure success. Table 2-5 shows a set of sample target outcomes, along with a potential check to 
confirm whether those outcomes are met. 
2.2 Scope Performance Domain 
Scope carries a unique and central place in project management, as the value of a project derives 
from the outcome delivered in alignment with its scope. The Scope performance domain includes 
the processes required to ensure that the project encompasses all of the work required to complete 
the project successfully and that only the required work is mapped and no unnecessary work is 
performed, thus helping to optimize costs and schedule in order to maximize the project’s value. 
In addition to defining and managing the scope, the Scope performance domain also focuses on 
project quality. Quality is defined by meeting stakeholder expectations and fulfilling the project and 
product requirements. This performance domain helps ensure that deliverables meet the specified 
acceptance criteria and that the processes used to produce them are effective and efficient. The 
domain emphasizes continuous process improvement, helping to ensure that both scope and quality 
are aligned and consistently meet the project’s objectives and standards. 
2.2.1 Key Concepts 
The following key concepts support effective practices for the Scope performance domain: 
• 
Business case. The business case is a documented economic feasibility study used to 
establish validity of the benefits to be delivered by a portfolio component, program, or 
project. Projects are initiated through a business case that outlines costs, benefits, and how 
value will be created, together with project success criteria.

Table 2-4. Governance Interactions With Other Performance Domains 
Performance Domain 
Scope 
Explanation 
Since project scope is where the project’s core value lies, the Governance 
and Scope performance domains often comprise the most important domain 
interaction. The Scope–Governance approach can have extensive formal con-
trols or be more informal, but such governance decisions are pivotal. 
Schedule 
Because most projects involve some form of investment—be it fnancial, 
strategic, or otherwise—and because the value proposition is often sensitive 
to time, the interaction between the Governance and Schedule performance 
domains can be critical. 
Well-applied governance may increase a project’s speed and effectiveness, 
while poorly applied governance can slow it down or result in ineffective 
outcomes. 
Finance 
All projects are investments, and the value proposition of any investment is 
sensitive to the amount being invested (i.e., cost). Consequently, the interac-
tion between the Governance and Finance performance domains can impact 
projects with cost overruns or underruns. 
Stakeholders 
Well-applied project governance can help ensure that all stakeholders are 
engaged at the right time in order to achieve project success. Governance 
considers the vantage points of all players to help ensure individuals are 
aware of what is happening in a project and can give input, provide advice, or 
perform work at the appropriate time. 
Resources 
Since the completion of project work is heavily dependent on how well the 
right resources are allocated to the right project priorities at the right times, 
the interaction between the Governance and Resources performance domains 
requires attention in the context of the specifc project, as well as how resour-
ces are allocated across the organization. 
Risk 
All projects are investments with inherent risks, requiring effective interaction 
between the Governance and Risk performance domains. Risks, encompas-
sing both threats and opportunities, impact project outcomes. Mitigating risks 
or seizing opportunities should align with strategic objectives and be managed 
under clear governance to optimize risk-adjusted returns. 
For example, risk mitigation efforts may incur additional expenditures, but 
they can be worthwhile if they enhance the overall project outcomes, such 
as improving safety, regulatory compliance, stakeholder confdence, or the 
risk-adjusted return on investment.

Table 2-5. Check Outcomes—Governance Performance Domain 
Outcome 
Check 
Projects have an appro-
priate level of oversight by 
leadership and third-party 
stakeholders. 
Project teams understand there are agreed-upon processes, protocols, team 
agreements, or other forms of project governance in tasks in which they are 
involved. These agreed-upon processes are documented (as appropriate) and 
aligned with the other organizational governance artifacts (policies, standards, 
procedures, etc.). 
Project governance pro-
cesses are in place, effec-
tive, and continuously 
improved throughout the 
project. 
Project teams have awareness of—and act appropriately on—governance 
structure (policies, standards, procedures, guidelines); internal and external 
auditing/compliance; and customer governance requirements. 
Project teams ensure that governance of interactions comes from both 
organizational and third-party governance and is integrated within project 
governance. 
The project team may check governance using instruments such as compliance 
audits or checklists against internal or external standards/benchmarks for 
predictive approaches. 
Project teams may ensure that the governance checklist is used regularly, 
timeboxing is in place, and meetings are held. 
Effective signaling 
mechanisms tied to target 
project outcomes are in 
place. 
Project teams select and use one or more signaling mechanisms that will 
align most closely to how the project can maximize its value proposition. 
Lessons learned/ 
retrospectives are 
managed throughout the 
project. 
Project teams ensure that the project and organizational knowledge and 
learning are combined to manage project deliverables and value. Lessons 
learned are incorporated during the ongoing processes, not only at the end of 
the project. 
Key management mem-
bers are kept apprised of 
the project. 
Project metrics are in place and tracked regularly. 
Project teams focus efforts on: 
•  Operational status and progress of project components and related 
 
activities; 
•  Expected and incurred project resource requirements; 
•  Known project risks, their response plans, and escalation criteria; 
•  Strategic and operational assumptions; 
•  Benefts realized; 
•  Decision criteria, tracking, and communication; 
•  Project change control; 
•  Compliance with corporate and legal policies; 
•  Project information and communications management; 
•  Issues and issue response plans; and 
•  Project funding and fnancial performance.

• 
Project scope. Project scope encompasses the work performed to deliver a product, 
service, or result with the specified features and functions. The project scope helps ensure 
that the expected value is achieved. Scope encapsulates a project’s expected value, so it is 
the most important component of any project’s baseline. The delivery of any project’s scope 
should generate expected value that is not only worth the time and resources invested, but 
also ideally maximized. 
• 
Requirement. A requirement is a condition or capability that is necessary to be present in a 
product, service, or result to satisfy a business need. 
• 
Scope baseline. In predictive environments, the scope baseline is the approved version 
of formal scope documents that can be changed using formal change control procedures 
and is used as the basis for comparison to actual results. The scope baseline forms part of 
the performance measurement baseline (PMB), which also includes the schedule baseline 
and the cost baseline. For adaptive approaches, the baseline is defined at the beginning of 
each iteration and aligned with the prioritized requirements, based on the value expected 
from the delivery. In adaptive environments, it is usually a product owner who dynamically 
approves changes and generates them in a more flexible environment, without a formal 
change control procedure. 
• 
Work breakdown structure (WBS). In a project incorporating aspects of a predictive or 
hybrid approach, a WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be 
carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required 
deliverables. In projects using a predictive approach, the WBS, together with the project 
scope statement and the WBS dictionary, constitutes the scope baseline. 
• 
Quality as a feature. Quality is an integral attribute of scope and can include both 
functional and nonfunctional requirements of the product, service, or result. For example, 
the scope of a bridge-construction project would include a bridge but should also 
incorporate some target thresholds for how sturdy, long-lasting, and easy to maintain 
that bridge should be. These quality features are the same as any consideration of scope, 
including which cost and schedule trade-offs might yield the highest possible expected 
lifetime value per unit of investment. 
• 
Product scope. The product scope is a description of the features, functions, and 
characteristics of the product, service, or result the project is intended to deliver. It is what 
the end result should look like and what it should do. The focus is on the deliverables 
themselves, including their quality and performance specifications. 
• 
Value breakdown structure (VBS). A VBS is a hierarchical structure that connects the project 
scope and its intended value to the product scope that will generate that value. The top level 
of the VBS should include the major deliverables that have been discussed and generated 
among the stakeholders. The value that each deliverable is expected to add should be an 
input into each item as either a value-based number (e.g., dollars of revenue, students taught 
to read, or lives saved, depending on the project) or a percentage of the expected total value 
of the project (100% if the specific deliverable is mandatory). These value-added estimates 
can then be used to prioritize the deliverables and their work, as well as to estimate the drag 
cost of each critical path item. Each item at the top of the VBS can then be decomposed into 
its component subdeliverables, which in turn are decomposed through a work breakdown 
structure into the project scope and activities to create the valued items in the VBS. 
• 
Product backlog. The product backlog is a dynamic, prioritized list of work items and 
features. The product backlog provides teams in adaptive environments with a framework

for managing scope by focusing on value-driven outcomes, enabling continuous 
prioritization, and maintaining alignment with stakeholder expectations. 
• 
Definition of done (DoD). The DoD is a checklist of all the criteria required to be met so 
that a deliverable can be considered ready for customer use. In projects using an adaptive 
approach, a DoD is a shared understanding of the specific criteria that should be met 
before a piece of work (e.g., a user story, feature, or increment) is considered complete and 
ready for release to the next stage or the customer. 
2.2.2 Processes 
The Scope performance domain encompasses the processes necessary to define, develop, monitor, 
control, and verify the scope of a project, ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations and 
project objectives. The following processes are included in this performance domain (see Figure 2-13): 
• 
Plan Scope Management. The process of creating a scope management plan that 
documents how the project and product scope will be defined, validated, and controlled. 
• 
Elicit and Analyze Requirements. The process of determining, documenting, and 
managing stakeholder needs and requirements to meet project objectives. 
• 
Define Scope. The process of developing a detailed or high-level description of the 
project and product. In agile projects, the scope is typically considered at a high level, 
often represented by the product roadmap with its releases. This process also identifies 
the quality requirements and standards for the deliverables—and how to demonstrate 
compliance with them.

Develop Scope Structure. The process of subdividing project deliverables and project work 
into smaller, more manageable components. In agile projects, this effort corresponds to the 
decomposition of the product backlog (product backlog breakdown), where work items can 
be broken down into epics, features, and user stories. 
• 
Monitor and Control Scope. The process of monitoring the status of the project and 
product scope, managing changes to the scope baseline, measuring the quality of the 
deliverables, and ensuring fulfillment of the required standards. 
• 
Validate Scope. The process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project 
deliverables. 
2.2.2.1 Plan Scope Management 
The objective of this process is to create a scope management plan. This process defines how 
the project will be delivered by establishing all of the work required to complete the project 
and eliminating or removing unnecessary work that will not add value to the project. The scope 
management plan should be defined, developed, monitored, validated, and controlled based on the 
project life cycle. While the objective of scope management—ensuring value delivery—remains the 
same, the process is approached differently in adaptive projects, if compared to predictive projects, 
as it is more iterative and collaborative. The key benefit of this process is that guidance on scope 
management is provided to ensure that value is delivered to stakeholders (see Figure 2-14). 
2.2.2.2 Elicit and Analyze Requirements 
The objective of this process is to define and document the stakeholders’ needs associated with the 
features and functions required in the product, service, or result to assure quality and value will be

delivered to stakeholders. In an adaptive environment, the requirements are collected in the form of 
user stories that are then prioritized in a backlog. The key benefit of this process is that it provides 
direction and a starting point to define a product, service, or result that will add value to stakeholders 
(see Figure 2-15). 
2.2.2.3 Define Scope 
The objective of this process is to develop a detailed or high-level description of the project, 
product, and value expected to be delivered, as well as a quality management plan. This description 
may be done at the beginning of the project for predictive approaches or at the beginning of each 
iteration for adaptive and hybrid approaches. In predictive approaches, these deliverables should 
be structured in the WBS, whereas in adaptive approaches, these deliverables are progressively 
defined through a backlog. This process also identifies the quality requirements and standards 
for the deliverables, as well as determines how the project will demonstrate that the quality 
requirements are met. The key benefit of this process is that it helps ensure that the stakeholders 
and project team understand the value that will be delivered through a product, service, or result 
(see Figure 2-16).

2.2.2.4 Develop Scope Structure 
In projects using a predictive approach, the purpose of the WBS is to state the project objectives and 
define the required deliverables. The WBS represents a structured, hierarchical decomposition of 
the total scope of work into smaller, manageable work packages that can be easily assigned, tracked, 
and measured, ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear and shared understanding of the project 
deliverables. This shared understanding facilitates effective project planning, tracking, and controlling 
by assigning clear ownership and accountability for each deliverable. 
In projects with complex or interdependent deliverables, a WBS dictionary may be developed to 
provide additional details about each WBS component. The WBS dictionary supports the WBS by 
elaborating on elements such as scope descriptions, milestones, responsible parties, resource needs, 
and acceptance criteria. This detailed documentation enhances clarity and alignment across the team. 
In agile projects, the WBS corresponds to the product backlog, where work items can be broken 
down into epics and user stories. The product backlog is a prioritized list of the known features and 
work the project team will perform. The key benefit of this process is to provide a strategic view of 
the project’s scope and value. This process helps the project team to be aligned and working toward a 
common goal (see Figure 2-17). 
2.2.2.5 Monitor and Control Scope 
Monitor and Control Scope is the ongoing process of monitoring and managing changes to the 
project scope—and measuring the quality and value of the deliverables to fulfill quality standards. 
This process controls how requests for changes to the detailed project scope statement will be 
processed while also ensuring the deliverables meet the specified quality requirements and that 
the scope and quality are aligned to the scope baseline. This process also includes the monitoring 
and recording of results to assess performance and determine whether the deliverables meet 
expectations. The primary objective of managing and controlling scope is to ensure the product, 
service, or result is relevant and delivering value to the stakeholders, as well as fulfilling the 
requirements specified by the stakeholders (see Figure 2-18).

Dependency on external partners. In projects involving external partnerships, the 
decision on how to manage scope integration into contractual agreements is critical. This 
early alignment sets expectations and defines the boundaries within which the project will 
operate. Furthermore, managing scope in projects that involve third-party suppliers or 
subcontractors necessitates a harmonization of contractual obligations to ensure all parties’ 
scope-related commitments are synchronized. 
Figure 2-19. Validate Scope Inputs, Tools and Techniques, and Outputs 
2.2.2.6 Validate Scope 
The Validate Scope process has two main objectives: checking the processes being used to achieve 
quality standards and formalizing the acceptance of the deliverables. This process helps ensure that 
deliverables meet established quality standards and that these deliverables gain formal acceptance 
from stakeholders. The key benefit of this process is that the scope is validated through an objective 
process to assure value and quality in the product, service, or result delivered. This process also 
increases the probability of acceptance of the product, service, or result delivered (see Figure 2-19). 
2.2.3 Tailoring Considerations 
Given the uniqueness of each project, activities and processes within the Scope performance domain 
should be tailored to align with the project’s specific requirements and constraints. Considerations 
for tailoring include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
• 
Environmental dynamics. In environments characterized by high dynamism—where external 
factors such as market volatility, technological advancements, and customer preferences 
evolve rapidly—scope management should be particularly flexible. Projects operating 
under such conditions should incorporate iterative feedback mechanisms that allow scope

--- Page 150 ---

 
 
 
 
adjustments in response to real-time external inputs. This flexibility enables the project team 
to continuously refine and realign the project’s objectives with the evolving external conditions, 
thus maintaining relevance and ensuring that the delivered value remains high. 
• 
Design phase. Some industries, such as pharmaceutical and construction, rely heavily on 
the design phase of their projects. In such domains, it is essential to invest considerable 
effort in the early stages of scope definition to prevent costly changes during the later stages. 
This strategic rescoping, when done during the design phase, allows for a comprehensive 
evaluation of the project’s direction before substantial resources are committed. 
• 
Adaptive and hybrid life cycles. Adaptive ways of working are based on the refinement of 
the project scope, which takes place throughout several different iterations. Tailoring in a 
project using a hybrid approach may be even more challenging, as the overall expectations 
of the project are set with a scope baseline, schedule baseline, and cost baseline, whereas 
subteams may be working in iterations on the user stories contained in the backlog. In this 
case, there is an even greater need for a tailored approach to the activities and processes 
within this performance domain, taking into consideration the variety of ways of working 
used in the overall project. 
2.2.3.1 Examples 
The following are three examples of how these considerations might be applied: 
• 
Example 1. A project to develop a new product is set up using a backlog with user stories. 
Rather than delivering all the user stories that are on the backlog, the team focuses on the 
main product goals to satisfy the customer expectations. The scope of the project is refined 
through different iterations. 
• 
Example 2. A software project to release a mobile app is aimed at a new market where little 
information is available about customer preferences. Adopting an iterative approach with a 
clear minimum viable product (MVP), created with the minimum features collected in a backlog, 
could provide rapid feedback to the team and better support with adaptation to changes. 
• 
Example 3. A project for a new city park has been approved with a tight timeline for its 
execution. With multiple stakeholders providing requirements and feedback, the project 
manager decides to invest more time in the design phase, creating multiple mock-ups of 
the park to evaluate before beginning construction. 
2.2.4 Interactions With Other Domains 
The scope of a project does not exist in isolation; it is deeply interconnected with other performance 
domains that collectively determine a project’s success. While the Schedule and Finance performance 
domains are the most obvious ones, as they are directly impacted in any scope change, other 
domains like Risk and Stakeholders are significantly connected as well. 
One important aspect is understanding the governance mechanisms within a project, particularly as 
they relate to the broader organizational context. Changes to the project scope should be navigated 
within these established governance structures to address potential consequences such as the need 
for additional budgets or resources. Such changes may be subject to review and approval processes 
to ensure that relevant scope modifications are justified and aligned with the strategic objectives 
of both the project and the organization. This adherence to governance is vital because scope 
fundamentally drives the project’s value.

The scope defnition accuracy is measured as: Scope Defnition Accuracy (%) = 
(Planned Scope Items Correctly Delivered / Total Planned Scope Items) x 100 
Finally, managing risk is intrinsic to managing scope, as risks can significantly alter a project’s 
trajectory. Comprehensive risk analysis is crucial to understanding potential impacts on the project 
scope. Rescoping may be employed as a strategy to mitigate, avoid, or transfer risks. 
2.2.5 Check Results 
Activities within the Scope performance domain should be considered successful only if they

The project employs 
effective change 
management. 
Projects using a predictive approach have a change log that demonstrates 
changes, taking into consideration the impact on the Scope, Schedule, 
Finance, Stakeholders, Resources, and Risk performance domains. Projects 
employing an adaptive approach use a backlog to manage scope, showing 
the rate of accomplishing the scope, the rate of adding new scope, and the 
prioritization and inclusion of stakeholder feedback. 
There is a clear 
understanding of 
requirements. 
In predictive development, fewer changes in the initial requirements may 
refect understanding. In projects where requirements are evolving, each 
iteration provides a clear and well-defned understanding of short-term 
requirements, enabling a rolling wave approach to uncovering and refning 
longer-term requirements progressively. 
The project is aligned with 
business objectives and 
strategy. 
The business case and the organization’s strategic plan, along with the 
project-authorizing documents, demonstrate that the project deliverables and 
business objectives are aligned. 
Stakeholders accept 
and are satisfed with 
deliverables. 
Interviews, observation, and end-user feedback indicate stakeholder satis-
faction with the deliverables. Levels of complaints and returns may also be 
used to indicate satisfaction. 
Scope items are clearly 
defned in the project scope 
statement in percentages. 
Scope creep is measured 
in percentages. 
Scope creep, as a percentage, is measured as: Scope Creep (%) =  
(Total Deliverables / Unplanned Deliverables) x 100 
The stability of require-
ments is measured in 
percentages. 
The stability of requirements, as a percentage, is measured as: Requirements 
Stability (%) = (Total Requirements / Unchanged Requirements) x 100 
Sustainability is considered 
in the project scope. 
The WBS or backlog should include activities to manage sustainability (e.g., 
assess and manage CO2 emissions due to project activity, or manage the im-
pact of project execution on local biodiversity in case of a signifcant impact).
