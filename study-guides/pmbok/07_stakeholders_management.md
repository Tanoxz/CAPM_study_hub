Table 2-8. Check Outcomes—Finance Performance Domain 
Outcome 
The project contributes to business 
objectives and the advancement of 
strategy (value maximization). 
Check 
Check parameters such as return on investment (ROI) (metric), net 
present value (NPV) (metric), internal rate of return (IRR) (metric), 
cost-beneft analysis, key performance indicators (KPIs), objectives 
and key results (OKRs), CapEx, and OpEx. 
Project completeness is within or 
below budget. 
Check the variance analysis with metrics such as cost 
variance (CV) and cost performance index (CPI), as well as the 
accomplishment of fnancial targets with the vendors based on the 
signed contract. 
Project deliverables are validated 
according to the plan. 
Apply earned value management (EVM) and check other metrics as 
defned by the organization. 
Value is created as an investment or 
as a different kind of value from the 
fnancial perspective. 
Use different metrics to be measured as project success based on 
what is defned in the project success criteria for the project; for 
instance, the investment or potential value in the future. 
Financial visibility is achieved. 
Use tools such as trend analysis or graphical analysis and perform 
forecasting. 
2.5 Stakeholders Performance Domain 
The Stakeholders performance domain addresses the processes and tools related to stakeholder 
engagement, starting from the identification of stakeholders through the monitoring of their 
engagement during the whole life cycle of the project. The project sponsor, team members, and 
all the people impacted by—or who feel they may be impacted by—the project are considered as 
stakeholders. This performance domain is closely linked to communications management. Among 
other abilities, some key skills to develop in this performance domain are negotiation and conflict 
management. 
Internal and external stakeholders include individuals, groups, and organizations (see Figure 2-31). 
A project can have a small group of stakeholders or potentially millions of stakeholders. There may 
be different stakeholders in different phases of the project, and the influence, power, or interests of 
stakeholders may change as the project unfolds. 
Effective stakeholder identification, analysis, and engagement includes stakeholders who are 
either internal or external to the organization, those who are supportive of the project, those who 
are neutral, and opponents, who are not supportive of the project. The activities of identification, 
prioritization, and engagement should be reviewed and updated routinely, or at least when the 
project progresses through phases. While having relevant technical project management skills is an 
important aspect to delivering successful projects, possessing the interpersonal and leadership skills 
to work effectively with stakeholders is just as important, if not more so.

2.5.1 Key Concepts 
The following key concepts support effective practices for the Stakeholders performance domain. 
• 
Stakeholder engagement. Stakeholder engagement encompasses the activities conducted 
to identify and analyze stakeholder needs and manage expectations and communications 
to foster stakeholder support. Stakeholders are a crucial part of project management. 
Understanding and addressing their different needs, engaging them at the right time, keeping 
them properly informed, and communicating well are ways to maintain their engagement. 
Research shows that an active project sponsor is a critical success factor in achieving positive 
outcomes from projects. Engagement involves the following considerations: 
◾ 
Sponsor engagement. Sponsors are essential stakeholders who hold decision-making 
authority; secure human, material, or virtual resources; and ensure alignment with 
organizational strategy and project objectives. Sponsors are typically involved in 
activities such as: 
▶ 
Initiating the project and defining the project objectives and business case, 
▶ 
Approving the project charter and approving any changes to it,

▶ 
Assigning and empowering the project manager, 
▶ 
Initiating a steering committee and being a member of it, 
▶ 
Approving the project management plan and any changes to it, 
▶ 
Ensuring the long-term benefits realization of project deliverables, 
▶ 
Proposing project termination, and 
▶ 
Authorizing project completion. 
In many cases the project sponsor, especially on high-priority projects, may be a member of the 
executive leadership team. This arrangement requires specific effort in understanding the needs and 
ways of communication that may better fit this type of stakeholder. Research shows that an active 
project sponsor is a critical success factor in achieving positive outcomes from projects. 
• 
Stakeholder satisfaction. Stakeholder satisfaction should be prioritized and integrated 
into the project objectives. The key to driving stakeholder satisfaction is maintaining a 
focus on continuous communication with all stakeholders, including customers, end users, 
managers, executives, and team members, to understand their needs and expectations, 
address issues as they occur, manage conflicting interests, and foster appropriate 
stakeholder engagement in project decisions and activities. 
• 
Team engagement. The project team members are also critical stakeholders and 
should be treated as such. The work done and accomplished during the project comes 
from the team, as well as the recommendations on the way forward in challenging 
decisions that are then taken by the sponsor and stakeholders regarding the direction of 
the project. 
• 
Communications management. Communications management is a crucial concept for 
keeping stakeholders engaged. The way of communicating should be tailored based on the 
needs and best fit for the stakeholders, so they have all the information they need to make 
decisions and are aware of the possible risks related to certain actions. 
• 
Data-driven decision-making. Effective decision-making is a critical responsibility for 
project managers, especially when securing timely decisions from stakeholders. This 
effort requires thorough preparation of supporting materials and the ability to guide 
the decision-making process. With the increasing volume and complexity of project 
data, project managers can leverage AI-powered tools to efficiently collect, analyze, 
and interpret data, generating actionable insights. AI technologies, such as predictive 
analytics and data visualization, can enhance the project manager’s ability to present 
data-driven recommendations, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions with 
greater confidence and speed. Combining AI capabilities with strong leadership skills 
allows project managers to proactively guide stakeholders toward fact-based, strategic 
decisions. 
• 
Vendor and supplier management/procurement. Even though procurement is not 
a core part of this performance domain, there are important skills related to vendor 
management that the project manager should have. Vendors and suppliers are important 
stakeholders in projects where external resources are involved. In specific industries, such 
as construction, vendor management and procurement are key elements to the success of 
the project.

The Identify Stakeholders process involves selecting the individuals, groups, or organizations 
that have a stake in the project. The process includes identifying project stakeholders regularly 
and analyzing and documenting relevant information regarding their interests, involvement, 
interdependencies, influence, and potential impact on project success. The key benefit of this 
process is that it enables the project team to identify the appropriate focus for the engagement of 
each stakeholder or group of stakeholders. Continuous stakeholder identification can work as a risk 
management strategy as the project environment evolves. This process is performed periodically 
throughout the project as needed (see Figure 2-33).

2.5.2.3 Plan Communications Management 
The Plan Communications Management process involves the activities to plan how to communicate 
with the identified stakeholders, both inside and outside the team. Communication planning overlaps 
with stakeholder identification, analysis, prioritization, and engagement, and is closely aligned with 
the stakeholder engagement plan, assisting with consistency in communication strategies and 
alignment with stakeholder expectations. There may be different categories of information, such 
as internal or external, sensitive or public, and general or detailed. Analyzing the stakeholders, 
information needs, and categories of information provides the foundation for establishing the 
communication processes and plans for the project (see Figure 2-35). 
2.5.2.4 Manage Stakeholder Engagement 
Manage Stakeholder Engagement is the process of communicating and working with stakeholders, 
which includes collaborating with sponsors to meet their needs and expectations, addressing any 
issues, and fostering appropriate sponsor involvement. The key benefit of this process is that it allows 
the project manager to increase support and minimize resistance from stakeholders. This process is 
performed throughout the project (see Figure 2-36).

2.5.2.5 Manage Communications 
The Manage Communications process involves setting up and conducting communications with 
stakeholders (e.g., sponsors, customers, end users, team members, managers, or executives), 
both inside and outside the team (e.g., external vendors). Manage Communications is the process 
of ensuring the timely and appropriate collection, creation, distribution, storage, retrieval, 
management, monitoring, and ultimate disposition of project information. The key benefit of 
this process is that it enables an efficient and effective information flow between the project 
team and stakeholders. The Manage Communications process identifies all aspects of effective 
communication, including the choice of appropriate technologies, methods, and techniques. In 
addition, the process should foster greater flexibility in the communications activities, allowing for 
adjustments in the methods and techniques to accommodate the changing needs of stakeholders 
and the project (see Figure 2-37). 
2.5.2.6 Monitor Stakeholder Engagement 
The Monitor Stakeholder Engagement process involves assessing the effectiveness of stakeholder 
engagement efforts, identifying necessary adjustments to improve relationships, and refining strategies 
or plans to better meet stakeholder participation needs. The key benefit of this process is that it maintains 
or increases the efficiency and effectiveness of stakeholder engagement activities as the project evolves 
and its environment changes. This process is performed throughout the project (see Figure 2-38).

2.5.2.7 Monitor Communications 
Monitor Communications is the process of ensuring the information needs of the project and its 
stakeholders are met. The key benefit of this process is the optimal information flow as defined in the 
communications management plan and the stakeholder engagement plan. This process is performed 
throughout the project (see Figure 2-39). 
2.5.3 Tailoring Considerations 
Because each project is unique, activities and processes in the Stakeholders performance domain 
should be tailored. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
Organizational culture. Organizational culture is a key driver for tailoring stakeholder 
engagement. Flat organizations tend to rely on open communications and foster informal 
channels, whereas hierarchical organizations use more formal approaches. The entire 
communication and stakeholder engagement strategy should consider organizational 
culture in order to properly engage with stakeholders.

• 
Product. Products that allow or require interactive, incremental, or event-exploratory 
approaches usually bring a specific framework for stakeholder interactions. For example, 
the software industry created common events (also known as ceremonies) such as product 
reviews, planning sessions, and project retrospectives, among others, to update and engage 
stakeholders. 
• 
Large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI). The use of AI should be 
assessed for each project through a decision-making process to determine when AI can 
assist with tasks or provide more time for other valuable activities. The evaluation should 
be focused on the use of AI to produce some artifacts for communication with the sponsor, 
stakeholders, team, and vendors. Proactive security and ethics measures should be 
considered, such as project managers engaging with the appropriate stakeholders (e.g., the 
cybersecurity team, if applicable), to understand if the risk of incorporating AI is acceptable 
for the organization.

2.5.3.1 Examples 
The following are three examples of how these considerations might be applied: 
• 
Example 1. Agile projects require continuous feedback on features and user stories to 
ensure product alignment with stakeholder needs. To facilitate this, teams often employ 
daily coordination meetings and utilize dedicated communication platforms for real-time 
collaboration and information sharing. This approach fosters rapid adjustments, increased 
stakeholder engagement, and accelerated time to market. 
• 
Example 2. A project in the manufacturing industry involves implementing a large-scale 
enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Thus, formal project updates are disseminated 
via biweekly email newsletters and monthly town hall meetings to ensure alignment across 
hierarchical levels.

• 
Example 3. A medium-sized global project requires inclusive communication strategies. 
Thus, multilingual updates and monthly virtual forums help ensure engagement and 
feedback from stakeholders across different cultural backgrounds. 
Based on stakeholders’ varied needs and preferences, there should be different communication 
methods (e.g., email for formal updates, instant messaging for quick questions, feedback loops, 
face-to-face meetings, etc.) or adjustments to the level of detail in communications based on each 
stakeholder’s role in the project. 
A complex project with numerous stakeholders may require a more sophisticated communications 
management plan compared to smaller projects, where the communication channels are more 
limited in number. 
2.5.4 Interactions With Other Domains 
Stakeholders permeate all aspects of projects. Stakeholders define and prioritize the requirements 
and scope for the project team, participate in and shape project planning, and determine the 
acceptance and quality criteria for the project deliverables and outcomes. Much of the project work 
revolves around engaging and communicating with stakeholders. Throughout a project or at its 
closure, stakeholders use the project deliverables and influence the realization of project outcomes.

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
 
 
Some stakeholders can assist in lowering the amount of uncertainty present on a project, whereas 
others may cause an increase in uncertainty. The stakeholders may influence the project risks, 
especially when the right stakeholders are not identified at the beginning of the project and are 
not updated and checked throughout the duration of the project. Stakeholders, such as customers, 
senior management, project management office leads, or program managers, may focus on 
measures of performance for the project and its deliverables. 
The Stakeholders performance domain closely interacts with the Governance performance domain, 
particularly through the skills needed to engage with project governance bodies and organizational 
leadership. These interactions demonstrate how the Stakeholders domain connects with other 
performance domains, although they do not capture all the ways stakeholder interests can influence 
a project. 
The Stakeholders performance domain also aligns with the Finance performance domain, as 
stakeholders often help define budgets, make funding decisions, and oversee financial controls. 
These connections highlight the critical role stakeholders play in shaping both the direction and 
success of a project. 
2.5.5 Check Results 
Activities related to the Stakeholders performance domain should be considered successful only if 
they contribute to specific outcomes. Table 2-9 shows a set of sample target outcomes, along with a 
potential check to confirm whether those outcomes are met.
