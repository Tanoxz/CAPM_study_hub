the value of the project investment. To that end, each performance domain concludes with 
guidance on maintaining a focus on that value. For any process output, there should be a 
corresponding, higher-order outcome in mind. A project schedule itself does not add value; 
its true importance lies in fostering stakeholder alignment around the overall timeline for 
delivering project value. 
2.1 Governance Performance Domain 
Project governance is applicable across all project management approaches, including predictive, 
adaptive, and hybrid, with variations based on industry, organizational context, and project specifics. 
Governance consists of the framework, functions, and processes that guide project management 
decisions and activities to optimize the project’s value delivery. This governance framework is holistic 
and integrative, considering all other performance domains. 
Project governance is shaped by the performing organization’s governance model as well as 
stakeholders such as customers and regulatory bodies. The Governance performance domain 
includes elements of project integration management related to strategic alignment, decision-
making and change, and project success criteria. Additionally, the Governance performance domain 
integrates risk and opportunity management, helping ensure proactive identification and mitigation 
of potential issues while leveraging opportunities for added value. This performance domain also 
helps to ensure project alignment with the portfolio, organizational strategy, and goals. Additionally, 
the domain involves interrelated activities to identify, define, combine, unify, and coordinate various 
processes, documents, and project management activities as an integrated system for value delivery. 
These activities often leverage technology and data-driven tools, enabling real-time tracking, analysis, 
and reporting to support informed decision-making. 
Governance can be tailored to different approaches: lightweight for adaptive methods; moderate 
or combined for hybrid projects; and comprehensive for large, predictive portfolios, programs, 
and projects. To help ensure continuous improvement, feedback loops are incorporated into the 
governance framework, allowing for periodic reviews, lessons learned, and iterative adjustments to 
governance practices. 
2.1.1 Project Value Creation 
The fundamental objective of any project is to create positive value that justifies the investment and 
effort undertaken. Effective governance involves oversight and corrections to help steer a project 
toward its broader goals. 
The Standard for Project Management [1] defines five Focus Areas for the success of any project. The 
relationship of the Governance performance domain to those Focus Areas is as follows: 
• 
Initiating. Successful projects begin with a clear description of the desired end state. 
A clearly articulated business case enables stakeholder alignment on priorities and 
constraints, and provides team members with a broader context that informs their work. 
This alignment can be implemented as part of the Initiate Project or Phase process, via 
informal governance discussions, and/or other approaches. 
• 
Planning. Every part of project planning should be performed with the project’s target 
goals in mind. Explicit deliverables and activities should be identified to enable those goals. 
This alignment is illustrated in the Integrate and Align Project Plans process.

• 
Executing. Project work can benefit from the shared understanding of its broader goals, 
such as informing technical decisions or motivating team members. This understanding can 
be seen in the Manage Project Execution and Manage Project Knowledge processes. 
• 
Monitoring and Controlling. As projects proceed, they encounter change. Effective project 
management requires appropriate adaptations to those changes. The Monitor and Control 
Project Performance process provides a way to govern effective changes toward value 
creation. 
• 
Closing. All projects and project phases eventually end. They can achieve their desired 
impact as originally planned, or experience closure earlier or later than expected. 
Projects experience any number of governance scenarios during their life cycle. In each case, the 
overarching value proposition should be the primary factor in project decisions. Table 2-2 illustrates 
several such scenarios. 
Several management disciplines relate to the governance of project value and impact. These 
include but are not limited to change management, benefits realization, value management, and 
revenue management. Tools and techniques from these disciplines are often incorporated into the 
Governance performance domain. 
2.1.2 Project Governance Models 
Applying the right governance model to a project is an important decision, because too much 
governance risks wasting resources, while too little may lead to strategic alignment and project 
performance issues. The need to apply optimum governance varies with the implementation approach 
and organizational guidelines. The right balance should be made for strategic alignment, compliance, 
and delivering value. For these reasons, governance models can be applied at the organizational, 
portfolio, program, or project level, depending upon the approach and complexity (see Figure 2-1).

Structured 
Governance 
Self-Governance 
Figure 2-1. Structured Versus Self-Governed Projects 
Under a structured governance model, project governance is often composed of an executive project 
sponsor, project management office (PMO) leader, some type of governance board, and a project 
manager who can provide project-level oversight while managing the integration of all performance 
domains for that project. Under a self-governance model, instead of a PMO leader, there may be a 
group of individual project managers that is collectively accountable for optimizing performance. 
There are proven and effective self-governance models where project management responsibilities 
are distributed among the team, rather than assigned to a single individual holding a formal project 
management title. 
A key challenge in self-governance models is the potential for fragmented decision-making, where 
decision-makers may act in conflicting ways, resulting in a lack of direction or accountability. To 
address this, it is essential to establish clear, measurable common objectives supported by leading 
indicators and effective feedback mechanisms. These tools enable self-governed teams to make 
informed decisions and align their efforts toward shared goals. Notably, structured governance 
models emphasize similar principles, as detailed in Section 2.1.3. 
In a structured governance model, which is often used on more predictive projects, one or 
more internal or external constituents governs project performance according to organizational 
requirements. In a self-governing model, which is often used on more adaptive projects, the team 
ensures the project is delivering value. Governance models should be designed to fit the specific 
needs of the project within the particular organizational context in which value is being delivered.

2.1.3 Metrics and Mechanisms for Effective Project Governance 
Regardless of whether the project governance model is structured or self-governing, or some 
combination of the two, effective governance typically requires these three core components: 
• 
Target metrics for the project that are clearly aligned and demonstrate meaningful impact 
to the organization’s strategic goals; 
• 
Clear and effective signaling mechanisms or alarm systems for those metrics (typically, 
leading indicators to give decision-makers and other stakeholders a sense as to whether 
the current delivery performance is bringing teams closer to the strategic goal); and 
• 
Effective feedback mechanisms that allow decision-makers in governance and integration 
management to assess the success of their decisions, learn from the feedback, and improve 
their decision-making effectiveness. 
Examples of some key metrics for good project governance may include but are not limited to the 
following: 
• 
Indicators for how effective the project-prioritization decisions are, such as return on 
investment (ROI); 
• 
Indicators on whether better decisions are being made to maximize due date performance; 
and 
• 
Indicators on whether the current integrated project baseline is truly the one carrying the 
highest possible value proposition. 
Each of these example metrics serves as direct or proxy measures for how well projects are 
achieving their target outcomes, as opposed to input metrics such as utilization of project resources, 
compliance with a given set of standards, or percentage of team members completing a training class. 
2.1.4 Additional Considerations for Predictive Environments 
Predictive project environments may call for two additional governance components: escalation and 
investment control. 
• 
Escalation is often useful in hierarchical organizations where decision-making authority 
includes individuals outside of project team members, or in organizations in which higher-
ranking individuals have greater ability to remove persistent obstacles or resolve conflicts 
to enhance a project’s probability of success. 
• 
Investment control is often required in environments that call for some type of formal 
stewardship of project investment funding, such as public corporations, government 
agencies, and certain financial entities (e.g., retirement funds). Investment control 
frequently includes a thorough risk evaluation procedure to analyze the possible returns 
on investment and reduce potential risks. For example, many lender-financed construction 
projects have defined decision points in the design and build phases of the project to 
determine whether the next round of investment funding still makes good business sense 
for the lender and overall project.

2.1.5 Key Concepts 
The key concepts detailed in Sections 2.1.5.1 through 2.1.5.4 support effective practices for the 
Governance performance domain. 
2.1.5.1 Leading Indicators 
Leading indicators indicate upcoming changes or reveal trends in the project. If the change or trend is 
unfavorable, the project team should evaluate the root cause of the leading indicator measurement and 
take corrective actions to address the trend. Used in this way, leading indicators can reduce performance 
risk on a project by identifying potential performance variances before they cross the tolerance threshold. 
Leading indicators may be quantifiable, such as the size of the project or the number of items 
that are in progress in the backlog. Other leading indicators are more difficult to quantify, but 
they provide early warning signs of potential problems. The lack of a risk management process, 
stakeholders who are not available or engaged, or poorly defined project success criteria are all 
examples of leading indicators that project performance may be at risk. 
Using leading indicators is preferable whenever possible because they can be used to prevent future 
problems that may require rework. 
2.1.5.2 Lagging Indicators 
Lagging indicators measure project deliverables or events. These indicators provide information after 
the fact. Lagging indicators reflect past performance or conditions and are easier to measure than 
leading indicators. Examples include the number of deliverables completed, the schedule or cost 
variance, and the amount of resources consumed. 
Lagging indicators can also be used to find correlations between outcomes and environmental 
variables. For example, a lagging indicator that reveals a schedule variance may show a correlation 
with project team member dissatisfaction. This correlation can assist the project team in addressing a 
root cause that may not have been obvious if the only measurement was the schedule status. 
2.1.5.3 SMART Criteria 
SMART criteria are guidelines used to set clear, attainable, and meaningful goals. The acronym 
SMART stands for specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound. These criteria help 
ensure that objectives are well defined and reachable within a certain timeframe, making them more 
effective and easier to track. 
2.1.5.4 Sourcing Strategy 
Project resources can be insourced, outsourced, or both. Determining which parts of a project should 
use which approaches represents a set of governance decisions. A project’s sourcing strategy should 
consider impacts to schedule, scope, finances, resource capacity, risks, and other considerations. 
These considerations include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
How might the project organization’s culture, differentiating skills, and proximity motivate 
more use of internal resources? 
• 
How might the project’s need for specialized skills or supplies, scaled capacity, or variable 
capacity motivate increased use of outsourcing?

• 
How might the use of external resources impact the project’s overall risk profile? 
• 
How might using internal or external resources benefit the overall value proposition? 
The management and oversight of outsourcing efforts can be performed by the project management 
team and/or a dedicated procurement department within an organization. Procurement 
management is the discipline of selecting, contracting, and supervising vendors to perform 
outsourced work. Procurement management is a complementary discipline to project management 
and is explored in Appendix X4. 
2.1.6 Processes 
The Governance performance domain encompasses the processes required to make decisions 
that protect and enhance the value proposition of a project in an integrated and holistic manner, 
including the authority to cancel a project when necessary. 
This performance domain also encompasses the processes and activities to identify, define, combine, 
unify, and coordinate the various processes and project management activities within the Project 
Management Focus Areas. 
In the project management context, governance includes characteristics of unification, consolidation, 
communication, and interrelationship. These actions should be applied from the start of the project 
through completion and integration as appropriate. The Governance performance domain involves 
making choices about the following: 
• 
Establishing a governance framework that aligns with organizational strategic and 
operational goals as well as ethical principles; 
• 
Defining roles and responsibilities for decision-making, oversight, and control; 
• 
Ensuring effective communication and coordination among stakeholders; 
• 
Monitoring and managing internal and external dependencies, risks, issues, and escalations; 
• 
Continuously assessing and optimizing the governance framework to improve project outcomes; 
• 
Balancing competing demands; 
• 
Examining any alternative approaches; 
• 
Tailoring the processes to meet the project objectives; 
• 
Managing the interdependencies among the performance domains by encouraging 
seamless collaboration and transition among various process performances; 
• 
Incorporating feedback mechanisms to adapt governance practices to evolving project 
needs; and 
• 
Ensuring compliance with regulatory and legal requirements to maintain organizational 
accountability. 
In summary, the Governance performance domain focuses on creating a structured approach 
to decision-making and oversight, helping to ensure that project activities are aligned with 
organizational objectives and that the value proposition of the project is protected and enhanced 
throughout its life cycle.

It should be noted that the processes of the Governance performance domain span across the 
project life cycle from initiation to closure. Governance is not a one-time activity; it is pervasive 
throughout the project life cycle. The following processes are included in the Governance 
performance domain (see Figure 2-2): 
• 
Initiate Project or Phase. The process of officially authorizing the start of a project by 
creating a document that establishes a link between the project and the business objectives. 
• 
Integrate and Align Project Plans. The process of consolidating and aligning all of the 
performance domain’s plan components into a unified project management plan that 
details how the project will be executed, monitored and controlled, and closed. 
• 
Plan Sourcing Strategy. The process of deciding whether to use internal or external 
resources for different parts of a project, considering factors such as organizational culture, 
specialized skills, resource capacity, risk, and the overall value proposition. Management 
and oversight of outsourcing efforts can be handled by the project management team or a 
dedicated procurement department. 
• 
Manage Project Execution. The process of leading and performing the work defined in the 
integrated project plans, including managing resources, addressing issues and risks, and 
implementing changes to achieve the project objectives. 
• 
Manage Quality Assurance. The process of ensuring processes are performed in a 
manner consistent with stakeholder expectations, involving the implementation of planned 
and systematic activities defined in the project’s quality management plan. This process 
helps build confidence in future outputs, improves process efficiency and effectiveness, and 
ensures proper project governance to meet or exceed stakeholder expectations.

• 
Manage Project Knowledge. The process of utilizing existing knowledge, including lessons 
learned, and creating new knowledge to achieve project objectives, enhance decision-
making, and contribute to organizational learning. 
• 
Monitor and Control Project Performance. The process of tracking, reviewing, and 
reporting overall project progress to meet performance objectives and provide an overview 
of the status of the project. 
• 
Assess and Implement Changes. The process of managing project changes that 
may impact various aspects of the project and adjusting plans based on stakeholder 
recommendations throughout the project life cycle. 
• 
Close Project or Phase. The process of finalizing all activities related to the project or 
phase, including archiving knowledge, completing planned work, and releasing resources 
for new projects or operations. 
2.1.6.1 Initiate Project or Phase 
The Initiate Project or Phase process officially authorizes the start of a project and grants the project 
manager the authority to allocate organizational resources to project activities by creating a project 
charter or similar document. Authorization—typically, but not always, via a charter—establishes a 
direct link between the project, the business case, and the organization’s strategic goals, creating an 
official record of the project and demonstrating the organization’s commitment to the project. This 
process is usually carried out once or at certain points during the life cycle of a project, depending on 
the project development approach (see Figure 2-3).

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
The project charter forms a partnership between the performing and requesting organizations. The 
approved business case, or similar item, justifies the reason behind initiating the project and the 
expected value. 
For cross-corporate projects with two or more organizations involved, contracts are used to establish 
an agreement among the organizations. Project charters are then used inside the organizations 
to create internal agreements to ensure fulfillment of contractual obligations, which are mostly 
deliveries made by contractors, with payments made by customers. The approved project charter 
formally initiates the project, identifying and assigning a project manager as early as possible, ideally 
during the development of the charter and always before planning begins. The project charter can be 
developed by the sponsor or the project manager in collaboration with the initiating entity, allowing 
the project manager to gain a better understanding of the project’s purpose, objectives, and expected 
benefits. This understanding facilitates efficient resource allocation to project activities. The project 
charter grants the project manager the authority to support the project. 
In adaptive approaches, project charters are often designed to be more flexible, ranging from 
minimally impactful worksheets or concise vision statements to moderately detailed documents. 
These charters are tailored to the iterative and incremental nature of adaptive projects, providing 
just enough structure to guide the team while allowing for evolving requirements and priorities. An 
adaptive project charter typically focuses on answering a subset or all of the following key questions: 
• 
Why is the project being undertaken? 
• 
Who will be engaged? 
• 
What is this project about? 
• 
Where will it occur? 
• 
When will it start and end? 
• 
How will it be carried out? 
• 
Who is the customer? 
By emphasizing clarity and flexibility, adaptive project charters can ensure alignment among 
stakeholders while maintaining the ability to adapt to changes throughout the project’s life cycle. 
2.1.6.2 Integrate and Align Project Plans 
The Integrate and Align Project Plans process involves integrating, aligning, and coordinating all plan 
components and consolidating them into a unified project management plan. The primary benefit of 
this process is the creation of a thorough document outlining the basis for the various aspects of all 
project activities and how they will be executed. This process is typically conducted once or at specific 
intervals during the project. 
The project management plan specifies how the project will be executed, monitored and controlled, 
and closed. Its content varies depending on the project’s application context and complexity. The plan 
can be either high level or detailed, tailored to the project’s specific needs. This plan should also be 
adaptable enough to respond to the dynamic project environment—ideally, by following a progressive 
elaboration approach—ensuring that more accurate information is available as the project progresses. 
The output of this process should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders.

Figure 2-4. Integrate and Align Project Plans Inputs, Tools and Techniques, and Outputs 
This documentation may take the form of a project governance plan, project management plan, 
project execution plan, project development plan, project implementation plan, or another document 
that transparently defines—for all team members and stakeholders—the project management 
framework within which decisions will be made (see Figure 2-4). 
At the beginning of the project, this process should establish the overall tailoring considerations and 
determine the development approach and project life cycle. This information should form part of the 
project management plan and serve as an input to all performance domains, guiding their planning 
efforts. Subsequently, all management plans and baselines from the performance domains should be 
integrated into the project management plan, and their alignments should be verified. Additionally, 
other management plans, such as the change management plan or configuration management plan, 
should be included if applicable. 
The amount of time spent planning, both up front and throughout the project, should be determined 
by the circumstances. Therefore, the information gained from planning should be sufficient to move 
forward in an appropriate manner but not more detailed than necessary. Project teams use planning 
artifacts to confirm stakeholder expectations and provide stakeholders with the information they need 
to make decisions, take action, and maintain alignment between the project and its stakeholders. 
2.1.6.3 Plan Sourcing Strategy 
The Plan Sourcing Strategy process entails documenting project sourcing decisions, specifying the 
source selection approach, determining the scope of work for external sourcing, and selecting the 
appropriate contracts and sources for delivering the work (see Figure 2-5).

This process establishes a clear framework for acquiring project deliverables, either from within 
the organization or from external sources, defining what to acquire, how to acquire it, and when to 
acquire it. 
The process is used to determine whether work or deliverables can be better accomplished using 
internal sources or should be purchased from outside sources. Several factors should be considered 
in the make-or-buy decision (see Table 2-3). 
In addition to supporting make-or-buy decisions, the sourcing strategy plan may also include 
determining the type of contracts to be used for external sources. These contracts should be 
consistent with the selected sourcing approach, taking into account factors such as project

•  Maintains supplier relations 
complexity, source performance, and risk exposure. The sourcing strategy plan includes developing a 
process for managing relationships with external sources, dealing with potential risks, and ensuring 
clear channels of communication throughout the project life cycle. 
A key part of this process is establishing source selection criteria, which help guide the evaluation and 
selection of vendors. These criteria may include cost, technical capability, past performance, financial 
stability, compliance with requirements, and alignment with organizational values or sustainability 
goals. Clearly defining these criteria ensures transparency and consistency in vendor selection and 
helps ensure that selected partners are capable of delivering the required scope of work effectively 
and reliably. 
The Plan Sourcing Strategy process differs from the Plan Resource Management process (see 
Section 2.6.2) as it involves the outsourcing of project work and deliverables, taking into account 
various factors such as determining the scope, time, cost, quality, and resources required to acquire 
the final work and deliverables from outside the organization. 
Participants in this process may include the purchasing or procurement department as well as 
personnel from the buying organization’s legal department. These responsibilities should be 
documented in the sourcing strategy plan. 
The Plan Sourcing Strategy process applies to projects where there is a need to use external sources 
to complete project work. For more information, see Appendix X4 on Procurement. 
2.1.6.4 Manage Project Execution 
The Manage Project Execution process involves leading and performing the work defined in the 
project management plan and implementing approved changes to meet the project’s objectives. The 
primary benefit of this process is the comprehensive management of project work and deliverables, 
which enhances the likelihood of project success. When leading project teams, the collective team 
members have more knowledge than any single person. Directing and managing execution provides 
a way to align the knowledge and skills of all team members toward the project objectives. 
This process includes executing the planned project activities to complete deliverables and 
achieve set objectives. The process also involves allocating resources, managing their efficient use, 
and making adjustments to project plans based on the analysis of work performance data and

information. Deliverables are produced as outputs from activities conducted according to the project 
management plan (see Figure 2-6). 
The project manager, along with the project team, manages and enables the execution of planned 
activities to achieve project objectives, and harmonizes different aspects of both technical and 
functional activities within the broader project ecosystem. This process also involves reviewing the 
impact of all project changes and implementing approved changes, including corrective actions, 
preventive actions, and defect remediation. 
During project execution, work performance data is collected and communicated to applicable 
controlling processes for analysis. This analysis provides information about the completion status 
of deliverables and other relevant details about project performance. The work performance data 
is also used as an input to the Monitoring and Controlling Focus Area and serves as feedback for 
lessons learned to improve the performance of future work packages. 
Quality management is relevant during project execution. There are two ways in which quality should 
be addressed in a project. The first is during the construction of the project management process, 
which provides process quality assurance and value delivery throughout the project. The second is 
during deliverable construction and should be addressed through scope management and control.

At this point, quality should be focused on ensuring that deliverables are being produced according 
to the agreed-upon requirements set in the scope baseline. For adaptative approaches, the scope 
baseline may be called prioritized requirements or the sprint backlog. 
2.1.6.5 Manage Quality Assurance 
Manage Quality Assurance is the process of ensuring project processes are performed in a manner 
consistent with stakeholder expectations. This process involves translating the project management 
plan into executable activities that incorporate the organization’s standards, regulations, and 
policies. The key benefit of this process is that it increases the probability of meeting the project 
objectives as well as identifies ineffective processes and causes of poor project performance. This 
process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs are 
shown in Figure 2-7. 
Quality management is sometimes called quality assurance, although quality management has 
a broader meaning in non-project work. In contrast, project management differentiates quality 
assurance and quality control as two distinct efforts: 
• 
Quality assurance is about using project processes effectively. This effort involves 
following and meeting standards to assure stakeholders that the project’s final results will 
meet their needs, expectations, and requirements. Related concepts include regulations, 
compliance, and audits. 
• 
Quality control is about creating project deliverables that meet defined specifications 
and thresholds. This effort involves defining the attributes of the value generated by a 
project and ensuring project deliverables achieve those attributes. Related concepts include 
product design, testing, and defects.

The Manage Quality Assurance process implements a set of planned and systematic acts and processes 
defined within the project’s quality management plan that can help to achieve the following: 
• 
Build confidence that a future output will be completed in a manner that meets the 
specified requirements and expectations through quality assurance tools and techniques 
such as quality audits and failure analysis; 
• 
Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of processes and activities to achieve better results 
and performance and enhance stakeholder satisfaction; and 
• 
Ensure the project is governed properly, and thus increase the likelihood that it will meet or 
exceed stakeholder expectations. 
In agile or adaptive projects, quality assurance can be performed formally or informally, based on the 
context. In predictive projects, quality assurance is usually performed in a formal capacity, under the 
expectation that strong process quality will minimize variances in an otherwise stable project. 
Quality assurance tasks may be performed by the project management team, an external entity, or both. 
2.1.6.6 Manage Project Knowledge 
Manage Project Knowledge is the process of using existing knowledge and creating new knowledge 
to achieve the project’s objectives and contribute to organizational learning (see Figure 2-8). Key 
benefits of this process include the following: 
• 
Using prior organizational knowledge to produce or improve the project outcome, and 
• 
Collecting new knowledge created by the project to support organizational operations and 
future projects or phases. 
Knowledge management is concerned with managing both explicit and tacit knowledge for two 
purposes: reusing existing knowledge and creating new knowledge. The key activities that underpin 
both purposes are knowledge sharing and integration (incorporating knowledge from different 
domains, contextual knowledge, and project management knowledge). 
Managing projects requires both explicit and tacit knowledge: 
• 
Explicit knowledge. Explicit knowledge is formal and systematic; it is the type of knowledge 
that can be readily codified using words, pictures, or numbers. This type of knowledge 
includes manuals, procedures, and documented processes. Explicit knowledge is easily 
communicated and shared through information management tools such as databases, 
registers, and web searches. The following are key characteristics of explicit knowledge: 
◾ 
Codifiable. Can be documented in words, pictures, or numbers. 
◾ 
Formal and systematic. Structured and organized in a way that is easy to understand. 
◾ 
Easily communicated. Can be shared through manuals, procedures, and other 
documentation. 
• 
Tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is information that is embedded in a person’s mind and 
is highly personal. Tacit knowledge is difficult to articulate because it consists of technical 
skills, experiences, insights, and practical knowledge. Tacit knowledge is challenging to

formalize and communicate, making it hard to transfer to others or different projects. The 
following are key characteristics of tacit knowledge: 
◾ 
Personal and embedded. Resides within an individual’s mind. 
◾ 
Difficult to articulate. Challenging to express in words or documentation. 
◾ 
Experience-based. Includes insights, experiences, and practical skills. 
◾ 
Challenging to transfer. Cannot be easily shared or communicated to others. 
Managing knowledge involves more than just documenting explicit knowledge for sharing or 
obtaining lessons learned at the end of the project for use in future projects. Codified explicit 
knowledge lacks context and is open to different interpretations, so even though it can be more 
easily shared, it is not always understood or applied in the right way. Tacit knowledge has further 
context but is difficult to codify. 
Tacit knowledge resides in the minds of individual experts or in social groups and situations 
and is often shared through conversations and interactions between people. Tacit knowledge, 
often deeply ingrained in experts’ experience and intuition, can be shared within a project by 
fostering a collaborative and trust-filled environment. This effort involves creating opportunities 
for knowledge transfer through open communication, mentoring relationships, and team-building 
activities. Encouraging face-to-face interactions and hosting regular brainstorming sessions can 
help make implicit knowledge more accessible. The latest artificial intelligence (AI) technologies,

such as interview bots, add new, strong capabilities in capturing and sharing both tacit and explicit 
knowledge. An important objective of knowledge management is converting tacit knowledge into 
explicit knowledge when possible. 
Determining how and when lessons learned and retrospectives will be conducted throughout the 
project helps support knowledge management. Identifying which information should be collected 
both during the project and at its closure is essential. Additionally, project managers should establish 
how historical information and lessons learned will be made available to benefit the current project 
and future projects. When managing project knowledge, AI can be leveraged as a significant source 
of knowledge. Significant risks are associated with the use of AI, including unintentionally exposing 
sensitive information and experiencing AI hallucinations. Projects should have responsible AI policies 
to manage the related knowledge. 
Effective knowledge-sharing mechanisms foster a collaborative, evidence-based working environment 
throughout the project. Through these mechanisms, valuable insights are captured, shared, and 
utilized to enhance project outcomes and drive continuous improvement. 
2.1.6.7 Monitor and Control Project Performance 
Monitor and Control Project Performance is the process of tracking, reviewing, and reporting the 
overall project progress to meet the performance objectives defined in the project management plan. 
The key benefits of this process are that it allows stakeholders to understand the current state of the 
project, recognize actions taken to address any performance issues, and gain visibility into the future 
project status with cost and schedule forecasts (see Figure 2-9). 
This process includes evaluating project performance during execution and assessing whether 
decisions might enhance the project’s value proposition. If a decision is likely beneficial and results in 
a change to the project baseline, integrated change control should be employed. 
Monitoring is an ongoing aspect of project management performed throughout the project. 
Monitoring involves collecting, measuring, and assessing data and trends to drive better project 
outcomes, maintain project health, and identify areas needing special attention. Controlling involves 
determining corrective or preventive actions, replanning, and following up on action plans to ensure 
that performance issues are resolved. The Monitor and Control Project Performance process involves 
the following: 
• 
Evaluating performance compared to plan; 
• 
Tracking the utilization of resources, work completed, budget expended, etc.; 
• 
Demonstrating accountability; 
• 
Providing information to stakeholders; 
• 
Assessing whether project deliverables are on track to deliver planned benefits; 
• 
Conducting conversations about trade-offs, threats, opportunities, and options; 
• 
Evaluating current risks, identifying new ones, and monitoring responses; 
• 
Ensuring project deliverables will meet the customer acceptance criteria; and 
• 
Updating the sourcing strategy to better meet project goals and constraints.

Figure 2-9. Monitor and Control Project Performance Inputs, Tools and Techniques, and Outputs 
The Monitor and Control Project Performance process is linked to measurement, as it relies on 
the continuous tracking, review, and reporting of project metrics to ensure alignment with the 
performance objectives set out in the project management plan. Effective measurement provides the 
necessary data to assess project progress, resource utilization, and the status of the project. 
By collecting and analyzing leading and lagging indicators, project practitioners can identify potential 
problems early, make informed decisions, and take corrective or preventive action to keep the 
project on track. Measurement also facilitates accountability and transparency, allowing stakeholders 
to understand the current status of the project and its future development. The Monitor and Control 
Project Performance process is thus supported by robust measurement techniques that drive 
process improvements and increase the likelihood of project success. 
Measurement requires time and effort that could be allocated to other productive tasks; 
therefore, project teams should focus on measuring only what is relevant and ensure that the 
metrics are actionable. Metrics should adhere to the SMART criteria explained in Section 2.1.5.3 
to be effective.

2.1.6.7.1 Measurement Pitfalls 
Project measurements help the project team meet the project objectives. However, there are some 
pitfalls associated with measurement. Awareness of these risks can help minimize their negative 
effects. Project practitioners should be aware of the following risks: 
• 
Hawthorne effect. The Hawthorne effect states that the very act of measuring something 
influences behavior. Therefore, take care in establishing metrics. For example, measuring 
only a project team’s output of deliverables can encourage the project team to focus on 
creating a large volume of deliverables rather than focusing on deliverables that would 
provide higher customer satisfaction. 
• 
Vanity metric. A vanity metric is a measure that shows data but does not provide useful 
information for making decisions. Measuring page views of a website is not as useful as 
measuring the number of new viewers. 
• 
Demoralization. If measures and goals are set that are not achievable, project team 
morale may fall as the team continuously fails to meet targets. Setting stretch goals 
and aspirational measures is acceptable, but people also want to see their hard work 
recognized. Unrealistic or unachievable goals can be counterproductive. 
• 
Misusing the metrics. Regardless of the metrics used to measure performance, there 
is the opportunity for people to distort the measurements or focus on the wrong thing. 
Examples include: 
◾ 
Focusing on less-important metrics rather than the metrics that matter most, 
◾ 
Focusing on performing well for short-term measures at the expense of long-term 
metrics, and 
◾ 
Working on out-of-sequence activities that are easy to accomplish in order to improve 
performance indicators. 
• 
Confirmation bias. Human beings tend to look for and see information that supports their 
preexisting points of view. This bias can lead people to make false interpretations of data. 
• 
Correlation versus causation. A common mistake in interpreting measurement data 
is confusing the correlation of two variables with the idea that one causes the other. For 
example, seeing projects that are behind schedule and over budget might cause one to 
infer that those projects are over budget because of schedule issues. This assumption 
may not be true, nor is it always true that projects that are behind schedule cause budget 
overruns. Instead, there are likely other correlating factors that are not being considered, 
such as skill in estimating, the ability to manage change, and actively managing risks. Being 
aware of the pitfalls associated with metrics can help with establishing effective metrics in 
addition to being vigilant regarding the dangers related to inappropriate measures. 
2.1.6.8 Assess and Implement Changes 
The Assess and Implement Changes process occurs from the start of a project through its completion, 
as changes can occur at any stage. Change requests can affect various aspects such as project scope, 
product scope, project management plan components, and project documents. Such changes can be 
proposed by any stakeholder and may occur at any point in the project life cycle. The degree of project 
change request management that is applied depends on the scope of the project, its complexity, the 
contract requirements, and the development approach being used (see Figure 2-10).

2.1.6.8.1 Predictive Approaches 
In predictive project approaches, changes are not formally controlled until baselines are established. 
However, once the project has a baseline, all changes should go through a formal process to assess 
and implement changes. The configuration management plan for the project should specify which 
project artifacts are subject to configuration control. Changes to these artifacts require a formal 
change request. 
Although changes can be initiated verbally, they should be documented in writing and entered 
into the change or configuration management system. Change requests should typically include 
information on the estimated schedule and cost impacts before they can be approved. If a change 
request impacts a project baseline, integrated change control measures should follow a formal 
process to assess and implement those changes. Each documented change request should be 
approved, deferred, or rejected by a designated person, such as the project sponsor or project 
manager, as specified in the project management plan or organizational procedures. 
Figure 2-11 shows an example flow of how the Assess and Implement Changes process might be 
performed.

Figure 2-11. Example Flow for Project Changes 
When applicable, a change control board (CCB) or project board may be involved. The CCB is a 
formally established group responsible for reviewing, evaluating, approving, deferring, or rejecting 
changes—and for documenting and communicating these decisions. While awaiting the decision 
of the CCB, project managers should continually execute planned tasks while also analyzing the 
impact and risks related to accepting or rejecting the proposed changes to minimize negative 
impacts. 
Approved change requests may require new or updated cost estimates, schedule adjustments, 
resource requirements, and risk assessments. These changes may also require updates to the 
project management plan and other project documents. Depending on the nature of the change, 
customer or sponsor approval may be required after CCB approval, unless the customer or sponsor 
is a CCB member. 
Changes are made to create improvements to the original plan and baseline, often based on 
changing conditions. The results of the changes should be monitored to ensure they yield the desired 
results. 
2.1.6.8.2 Adaptive Approaches 
In adaptive approaches, managing project changes typically involves backlog management 
rather than a formal change request process. Changes are continuously assessed and prioritized 
throughout the iterative development cycle. When a stakeholder proposes a change, it is recorded as 
a product backlog item and added to the backlog. Although these are not formally termed as change 
requests, an impact analysis is conducted to evaluate the change’s effect and set its priority. 
Typically, there is not a formal “approval” process; instead, any proposed change can be added to the 
backlog. If the proposed change is assigned a lower priority, this essentially means that the change 
is deferred. Conversely, choosing not to add a change to the backlog, or remove an existing change 
from the backlog, means that it is rejected.

The Close Project or Phase process involves finalizing all activities related to both successful and 
unsuccessful projects, phases, releases, iterations, or contracts. The primary benefits include 
archiving project or phase information, completing planned work, and releasing organizational 
resources for new projects. The process also includes confirming the extent to which value or the 
capability to deliver value has been achieved (see Figure 2-12).

2.1.6.9.1 Predictive Approaches 
For project closure, the project manager should ensure that all work is completed and that the 
objectives are met by reviewing the project management plan. Key activities for administrative 
closure in predictive approaches may include the following: 
• 
Satisfying completion or exit criteria. The following steps should be performed when 
satisfying the exit criteria in the Close Project or Phase process: 
◾ 
Ensure all documents and deliverables are updated and all issues are resolved. 
◾ 
Ensure that the measurable project value was delivered, and that there is a plan to 
maintain this value as the project is closed and transitioned to operations. 
◾ 
Confirm that deliverables have been delivered and formally accepted by the customer. 
◾ 
Verify that all costs have been charged to the project. 
◾ 
Close project accounts. 
◾ 
Reassign or release project personnel. 
◾ 
Address excess project materials. 
◾ 
Reallocate or release project facilities, equipment, and other resources. 
◾ 
Prepare final project reports as required by organizational policies. 
• 
Contractual agreement completion. The following activities should be verified when 
closing out contractual agreements in the Close Project or Phase process: 
◾ 
Confirm formal acceptance of the external source’s work. 
◾ 
Finalize any open claims, guarantees, and warranties. 
◾ 
Update records to reflect the final results. 
◾ 
Ensure all invoices due to external sources are paid. 
◾ 
Archive relevant information for future use. 
◾ 
Resolve any disputes that may arise or refer them to the dispute board. 
• 
Additional closure activities. The following additional closure activities should be 
performed in the Close Project or Phase process: 
◾ 
Collect and audit project or phase records. 
◾ 
Assess project success or failure. 
◾ 
Manage knowledge sharing and transfer. 
◾ 
Identify and document lessons learned. 
◾ 
Archive project information for future organizational use. 
◾ 
Transfer project products, services, or results to the next phase or into production/ 
operations. 
◾ 
Collect suggestions for improving or updating organizational policies and procedures 
and forward them to the appropriate unit. 
◾ 
Measure stakeholder satisfaction. 
◾ 
Verify that all contractual, regulatory, legal, social, and environmental obligations have 
been met.

Identify outstanding risks that should be accepted or transitioned to operations. The Close Project or 
Phase process also includes establishing procedures to investigate and document reasons that the 
project may have been terminated before completion. Engaging relevant stakeholders is crucial to 
ensure a comprehensive closure process. 
2.1.6.9.2 Adaptive Approaches 
In adaptative approaches, the Close Project or Phase process centers on wrapping up all activities related 
to the release or iteration, ensuring the prioritized items are completed and the value is delivered. 
Key activities for closing an adaptive project or iteration may include the following: 
• 
Completion of release or iteration. The following activities should be performed when 
completing a release or iteration in an adaptive project: 
◾ 
Confirm that prioritized backlog items are finished and that all acceptance criteria are met. 
◾ 
Ensure that all deliverables have been reviewed and accepted by stakeholders. 
◾ 
Conduct a final review to verify that all project tasks are completed and that no 
outstanding issues remain. 
• 
Knowledge transfer and retrospectives. The following knowledge transfer and 
retrospectives activities should be performed: 
◾ 
Facilitate knowledge-sharing sessions to transfer insights and information among the 
team. 
◾ 
Hold retrospectives to reflect on the iteration and/or release, identifying lessons 
learned and opportunities for improvement in future work. 
◾ 
Discuss outstanding risks that should be accepted or transitioned to subsequent 
iterations and/or releases, clients, and operations. 
2.1.7 Tailoring Considerations 
Project governance should be tailored to the context in which the project operates. Governance 
that brings value relies on deep knowledge of the industry and regulatory considerations, the 
organization, and the context for a particular project. Additionally, tailoring in this domain may occur 
based on predictive, adaptive, or hybrid approaches. In fact, agile projects may avoid traditional 
governance entirely in favor of self-governance that is embedded in project approaches. Customizing 
governance is typically part of the Initiate Project or Phase process but may occur iteratively 
throughout the project. Depending on the project approach, outcomes of tailoring decisions may be 
recorded in the project management plan, another document, or a system of record. In organizations 
implementing predictive or hybrid approaches, a senior project manager—or in large organizations, 
a portfolio manager, program manager, or project management office—will likely handle project 
governance. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
Organizational governance. Governance should be understood from the perspective of 
other functions and projects within the larger organization. Governance requires the following: 
◾ 
Identifying the control boards, committees, and other stakeholders that are part of the 
project; and 
◾ 
Defining the project status reporting requirements.

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
 
 
 
Additionally, it is essential to assess whether the governance and integration in adaptive projects 
will lean toward self-governing teams and a total-quality approach. Determining whether and how 
a project management office should be involved is another critical step. Deciding if the team will 
establish a governance board and identifying which committees or stakeholders should be involved 
are further considerations to help tailor the governance approach to fit the specific needs and 
context of the project. 
• 
Guided self-governance. Agile or adaptive projects are designed to be self-governing, 
meaning that the teams involved have the autonomy to make decisions and manage their 
work without heavy bureaucracy and oversight. Instead, these teams manage their work 
with light governance and clear-set boundaries and guardrails. In this way, agile teams 
are empowered to make decisions about their work processes, priorities, and problem-
solving approaches—essentially, self-governance. Additionally, successful agile teams are 
comfortable with uncertainty and are willing to engage in collaborative decision-making. 
This collaboration involves facilitating open discussions, exploring differing opinions, and 
using constructive feedback to navigate through unknowns together. As an example, the 
practice of daily coordination meetings helps ensure teams maintain focus and alignment 
and serves as a self-governing mechanism toward that end. Adaptive teams operate 
with autonomy, leveraging iterative planning, collaborative decision-making, and focused 
communication to drive continuous improvement, which can lead to successful self-
governance. 
• 
Project life cycle adaptations. Governance should also be tailored to be appropriate for 
predictive, adaptive, and hybrid life cycles. This tailoring involves a continuous and iterative 
process of adapting the approach, governance, and processes to suit the unique objectives, 
stakeholders, and complexity of the environment. Such deliberate adaptation aims to 
maximize value, manage constraints, and improve performance by using “just enough” 
processes, methods, templates, and artifacts to achieve the desired project outcomes. 
For projects that apply lean/agile approaches, governance may be provided by the project 
team only in the artifacts and events of the project. Predictive projects may have heavier 
governance requirements due to internal and external constraints. Project managers 
should tailor the appropriate framework to enable flexibility and consistently produce 
positive outcomes within the project’s life cycle context. Factors such as the business 
environment, regulatory requirements, need for innovation, market conditions, team size, 
degree of uncertainty, and project complexity play a crucial role in how project systems are 
tailored. Additionally, organizations with established process governance should ensure 
that tailoring aligns with policy and strategy. The Disciplined Agile® (DA®) tool kit offers 
further guidance on lean/agile governance. 
2.1.7.1 Examples 
The following are three examples of how these considerations might be applied: 
• 
Example 1. A project may or may not be governed by a project management office 
(PMO). Thus, project managers should ensure that their governing approach is focused 
on delivering maximum value. In a small organization, the project manager may make 
decisions regarding project governance with other key leaders, while a project manager 
with access to a PMO in a large organization may partner with PMO leadership and/or other 
portfolio, program, and project managers to help ensure that a project is appropriately 
governed to achieve strategic alignment and deliver value.
