Introduction
This section describes important information about A Guide to the Project 
Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Seventh Edition. It 
describes the relationship of the PMBOK® Guide to The Standard for Project 
Management [1],1 changes to the PMBOK® Guide, the relationship to 
PMIstandards™ (PMI’s digital platform for standards), and provides a brief 
overview of the content.
1.1 Structure of the PMBOK® Guide
In addition to this Introduction, this edition of the PMBOK® Guide contains three sections:
▶ 	 Section 2 Project Performance Domains. This section identifies and describes eight project 
performance domains that form an integrated system to enable successful delivery of the project 
and intended outcomes.
▶ 	 Section 3 Tailoring. This section describes what tailoring is and presents an overview  
of what to tailor and how to go about tailoring individual projects.
▶ 	 Section 4 Models, Methods, and Artifacts. This section presents a brief description of commonly 
used models, methods, and artifacts. These models, methods, and artifacts illustrate the range of 
options project teams can use to produce deliverables, organize work, and enable communication 
and collaboration.

Guide.
 
 
 
Section 3 
Tailoring 
Tailoring is the deliberate adaptation of the project management approach, governance, 
and processes to align with the project’s environment and objectives. Tailoring considers the 
development approach, processes, project life cycle, deliverables, and the approach to stakeholder 
and team involvement, ensuring alignment with project objectives and constraints. 
3.1 Overview 
The tailoring process is driven by the guiding project management principles in The Standard 
for Project Management [1]. For instance, organizations with a low risk appetite often implement 
structured processes and oversight mechanisms to minimize uncertainty. In contrast, organizations 
with higher risk tolerance may prioritize agility and decision-making autonomy, adjusting process 
rigor based on project needs rather than applying a fixed number of procedures. Tailoring entails 
the mindful selection and adjustment of multiple project factors to determine which elements are 
most useful given the project context, goals, operating environment, scale, and complexity in order to 
better align with and achieve the project outcomes. 
Projects operate in unique contexts that should consider and balance potentially competing 
demands, including but not limited to the following: 
• 
Delivering as quickly as possible, 
• 
Minimizing project costs, 
• 
Optimizing the value delivered,

• 
Creating high-quality deliverables and outcomes, 
• 
Ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and sustainability considerations, 
• 
Satisfying diverse stakeholder expectations, and 
• 
Adapting to change. 
These factors should be understood, evaluated, and balanced to create a practical operating 
environment for the project. There may be situations that limit the degree to which project teams can 
tailor their approach (e.g., when organizational policies mandate the use of a specific approach or 
when a contract specifies a mandated approach). 
3.2 Why Tailor? 
The structure used to deliver projects can be extensive or minimal, rigorous or lightweight, and 
comprehensive or streamlined. In short, there is no single approach that can be applied to all 
projects all of the time. Tailoring is performed to better suit the organization, operating environment, 
and project needs. Many variables factor into this process, including the criticality of the project, 
scale, duration, complexity, industry standards, organizational culture, number of stakeholders 
involved, and level of organizational project management maturity. For example, the rigor, checks 
and balances, and reporting requirements for a critical nuclear reactor project are much greater than 
those for building a new office building. Similarly, the communication and coordination needs for a 
10-member project team are far less extensive than for a project team of 200 people. 
Too few processes can lead to ineffective project management, while employing more processes than 
required is costly and wasteful. Thus, tailoring leads to optimum and effective project management 
that can deliver direct and indirect value to organizations, including the following benefits: 
• 
More commitment from the project team members who helped to tailor the approach; 
• 
Customer-oriented focus enhancements, as the needs of the customer are an important 
influencing factor in its development; and 
• 
More efficient use of project resources. 
3.3 What to Tailor 
This section discusses three project aspects that can be tailored: 
• 
Life cycle and development approach selection, 
• 
Processes, and 
• 
Engagement. 
Sections 3.3.1 through 3.3.3 explore each of these in more detail. 
3.3.1 Life Cycle and Development Approach Selection 
Deciding on a life cycle and its phases is an example of tailoring; additional tailoring can be done while 
selecting the development approach for the project. For instance, building a new data center could

involve (a) the use of predictive approaches for the physical building construction and finishing and 
(b) an adaptive approach for understanding and establishing the computing capabilities required. 
Viewed from a project level, this combination of approaches represents a hybrid approach, but the 
construction team and the computing team may only experience a predictive or adaptive development 
approach. 
3.3.2 Processes 
Process tailoring involves determining which elements should be either: 
• 
Added, to address unique conditions or increase rigor; 
• 
Modified, to better fit project or team needs, including adjusting inputs, outputs, and tools 
and techniques; 
• 
Removed, to reduce unnecessary cost or effort; 
• 
Blended, to combine elements for added value; or 
• 
Aligned, to ensure consistency in definition and application. 
3.3.3 Engagement 
Tailoring engagement for the people involved in the project includes the following: 
• 
People. This effort involves assessing the skills and capabilities of the project leadership 
and team, ensuring they adapt to evolving project needs. 
• 
Empowerment. Empowerment involves choosing which responsibilities and forms of local 
decision-making should be deferred to the project team. The project environment and team 
member capabilities can lead to high levels of empowerment, while in other cases more 
supervision and directions may be required. 
• 
Integration. Tailoring considers how to create one project team from a diverse collection 
of contributors (contracted entities, channel partners, and other external entities, in 
addition to staff from inside the sponsoring organization) to facilitate optimal project team 
performance and the realization of project outcomes. 
3.4 The Tailoring Process 
Projects exist in environments that hugely influence how projects are executed and their resulting 
outcomes. Prior to tailoring, the project environment should be thoroughly analyzed and understood. 
Tailoring begins by selecting a development approach (e.g., predictive, adaptive, or hybrid), tailoring it 
for the organization and project, and finally, implementing its ongoing improvement. These steps are 
shown in Figure 3-1 and described in detail in Sections 3.4.1 through 3.4.4. 
3.4.1 Select Initial Development Approach 
This step determines the development approach that will be used for the project. Project teams apply 
their knowledge of the product, delivery cadence, and awareness of the available options to select 
the most appropriate development approach for the situation.

Figure 3-1. Details of the Steps in the Tailoring Process 
Tailoring project management approaches requires thoughtful consideration of contextual factors to 
ensure that the chosen methodology aligns with project needs and organizational goals. One useful 
concept in this regard is the suitability filter. A suitability filter is not a rigid method or procedure, 
but rather a decision-making tool that helps project teams evaluate their unique circumstances. 
A suitability filter assists project teams with analyzing the project’s characteristics and determining 
the best fit among predictive, adaptive, or hybrid approaches. The suitability filter combines its 
assessment with other data and decision-making activities, so the appropriate tailored approach is 
decided for each project. By evaluating criteria based on culture, project team dynamics, and project 
factors, a suitability filter assists discussion and decision on the initial approach. 
3.4.2 Tailor for the Organization 
Project teams own and improve their processes, but organizations can provide methodologies and 
development approaches as starting points for projects requiring oversight. These guides can help 
support repeatable processes, consistent capability measurement, and continuous improvement. 
Organizations that have established process governance should ensure tailoring is aligned to policy. 
Tailoring for the organization involves adding, removing, and reconfiguring elements of the approach 
to make it more suitable for the individual organization. This process is shown in Figure 3-2. 
Tailoring within an organization should also consider the context of the program and/or portfolio 
within which the project operates. Aligning tailoring decisions across related projects can enhance 
consistency and efficiency, promoting a cohesive approach within the organizational structure.

Figure 3-2. Assessing the Organizational and Project Factors When Tailoring 
A project management office (PMO), in organizations that have one, can play a vital role 
in reviewing and approving tailored development approaches, which is well aligned to 
organizational policy. Tailoring that impacts the project team requires less oversight than 
tailoring impacting external groups, so project manager approval is usually enough for internal 
project tailoring. Tailoring that affects external groups may require the approval of PMOs, which 
may also assist project teams as they tailor their approaches by providing ideas and solutions 
from other projects. 
Project management offices continue to evolve in form, function, and naming, reflecting the 
unique needs and delivery approaches of each organization. Regardless of structure, what remains 
consistent is the PMO’s alignment to business priorities. The mission of a PMO is often centered 
on solving critical organizational challenges such as enabling value delivery, ensuring compliance, 
improving cost control, or enhancing delivery consistency. 
Modern PMOs are increasingly expected to go beyond operational support, acting as enablers of 
strategy execution and contributors to enterprise-wide outcomes. Their ability to adapt services 
based on what the organization values most—and to evolve in response to changing priorities— 
determines their long-term relevance and impact. See Appendix X2 on PMOs for more details. 
Projects sometimes require the collaboration of multiple organizations, with each bringing its 
own processes, governance structures, and delivery approaches. In such cases, it is important 
that tailoring is done using a multiorganization approach to help ensure alignment and cohesion.

Tailoring in multiorganization projects requires careful consideration of how different organizational 
processes, governance structures, and delivery approaches align. Integration planning should ensure 
that tailored practices from each participating organization are harmonized to achieve cohesive 
project outcomes. 
3.4.3 Tailor for the Project 
The key attributes that influence tailoring for the project are the product or deliverable, project team, 
and culture. The project team should ask questions about each attribute to help guide them in the 
tailoring process. Answers to these questions can help identify the need to tailor the processes, 
development approach, life cycle, and tools and techniques. 
3.4.3.1 Product or Deliverable 
Key attributes associated with the product or deliverable include the following: 
• 
Standards compliance. How much process rigor and quality assurance are appropriate? 
• 
Type of product/deliverable. Is the product well known and easy to recognize, like a 
building, or something intangible like software or the design of a new drug or vaccine? 
• 
Industry market. What market does the project, product, or deliverable serve? Is that 
market highly regulated, fast moving, or slow to evolve? What about competitors and 
incumbents? 
• 
Technology. Is the technology stable and well established or rapidly evolving and at risk of 
obsolescence? 
• 
Timeframe. Is the project timeframe short, in weeks or months, or does it span several 
years? 
• 
Stability of requirements. How likely are there to be changes to core requirements? 
• 
Security. Are elements of the product business confidential or classified? 
• 
Incremental and iterative delivery. Is this something the project team can develop and 
get stakeholder feedback on incrementally and iteratively, refining the product through 
repeated cycles, or is it hard to evaluate until it is near completion? 
3.4.3.2 Project Team 
Project team considerations include the following: 
• 
Project team size. How many full-time and/or part-time people will be working on the 
project? 
• 
Project team geography. Where are the team members predominantly located 
geographically? Will some or all of the team be remote or colocated? 
• 
Organizational distribution. Where are the supporting groups and stakeholders located? 
Licensed To: Timon Kevenaar PMI Member ID: 12290374. This copy is a PMI Member benefit, not for distribution, sale, or reproduction.


--- Page 214 ---

• 
Project team experience. Do the project team members have any experience in the 
industry, organization, or working with one another? Do they have the skills, tools, and 
technology required for the project under consideration? 
• 
Access to customer. Is it practical to get frequent and timely feedback from customers or 
customer representatives? 
• 
Team diversity. Are there diverse skills, experiences, and perspectives within the team that 
can enhance problem-solving and innovation? 
3.4.3.3 Culture 
Evaluating the culture includes the following considerations: 
• 
Buy-in. Is there acceptance, support, and enthusiasm for the proposed development 
approach? 
• 
Trust. Are there high levels of trust that the project team is capable of—and committed 
to—delivering the project outcomes? 
• 
Empowerment. Is the project team trusted, supported, and encouraged to own and 
develop its working environment, agreements, and decisions? 
• 
Organizational culture. Do the organizational values and culture align with the project 
approach? This evaluation includes distinctions between empowering versus specifying 
and checking, and trusting local decision-making versus requesting external decision-
making, etc. 
Through the evaluation of these attributes, tailoring decisions around engagement, processes, and 
tools can be made for the project. 
3.4.4 Implement Ongoing Improvement 
The process of tailoring is not a single, one-time exercise. During progressive elaboration, issues 
with how the project team is working, how the product or deliverable is evolving, and other learnings 
can indicate where further tailoring could bring improvements. Review points, phase gates, and 
retrospectives all provide opportunities to inspect and adapt the process, development approach, 
and delivery frequency, as necessary. 
Keeping the project team engaged with improving its process can foster pride of ownership and 
demonstrate a commitment to implementing ongoing improvements and quality. Empowering 
the project team to find and implement improvements also demonstrates trust in their skills and 
suggestions. Project team engagement with tailoring demonstrates a mindset of innovation and 
improvement rather than settling for the status quo. 
The way an organization tailors itself can also be tailored. However, most organizations undertake 
some or all of the four steps described. Organizations can use elements of selecting an initial 
approach, tailoring for the organization, tailoring for the project, and implementing ongoing 
improvement, as shown in Figure 3-3.

Figure 3-3. The Tailoring Process 
3.5 Tailoring the Performance Domains 
The work associated with each performance domain can also be tailored, based on the uniqueness of 
the project. As shown in Figure 3-4, the principles for project management provide guidance for the 
behavior of project practitioners as they tailor the performance domains to meet the unique needs of 
the project context and environment. Tailoring consideration examples for each project management 
performance domain are specifically covered in Section 2 on performance domains. 
3.6 Diagnostics 
Periodic reviews, such as retrospectives or lessons learned, help assess the effectiveness of 
current approaches and identify areas for improvement through tailoring. Teams that do not use 
retrospectives can rely on issues, threats, quality metrics, and stakeholder feedback to determine if 
further tailoring is needed. Table 3-1 provides common situations and tailoring suggestions.

The deliverables are poor quality. 
Analyze the root causes of poor quality and implement targeted 
feedback and quality assurance measures where needed. Focus on 
process improvements rather than just increasing verifcation steps. 
Team members are unsure of 
how to proceed or undertake their 
work. 
Assess the specifc needs of the team to identify the most 
appropriate support mechanisms, including guidance, mentorship, 
training, and knowledge-sharing practices. 
Team members are not 
cooperative and are working in 
silos. 
Conduct team-building activities and hold individual meetings 
to understand the cause. Take actions to strengthen bonds and 
promote coordination among team members. 
There are long delays waiting for 
approvals. 
Streamline the approval process by appointing people who are 
authorized to make decisions up to certain value thresholds, 
shortening the time needed for approvals. 
There is too much work in progress 
and/or waste. 
Use techniques like value stream mapping and kanban boards to 
visualize work, identify issues, and fnd solutions. 
Stakeholders are not engaged or 
they share negative feedback. 
Assess whether stakeholders receive timely and relevant information, 
tailoring communication methods to balance simplicity with the need 
for deeper engagement. 
There is a lack of transparency 
and understanding about project 
progress. 
Check to ensure that appropriate data is collected, analyzed, shared, 
and discussed during team and stakeholder meetings. Validate 
agreement on the measures with the team and stakeholders. 
Issues and/or risks for which the 
team is unprepared continue to 
surface, requiring the team to 
react rather than make progress 
on their work. 
Explore root causes to identify whether there are related gaps in 
project processes or activities. 
3.7 Summary 
Tailoring adapts the approach, governance, and processes to fit the project’s environment and 
objectives, which involves analyzing and modifying people, processes, and tools. The tailoring process 
includes four steps: 
• 
Select the initial development approach, 
• 
Tailor for the organization, 
• 
Tailor for the project, and 
• 
Improve continuously. 
Tailoring is typically led by project stakeholders, with organizational guidelines and governance ensuring 
alignment and consistency across teams. Tailoring is not just about making changes, but also about 
verifying and validating that the tailored approaches are effective and aligned with project outcomes.

Introduction
This section describes important information about A Guide to the Project 
Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Seventh Edition. It 
describes the relationship of the PMBOK® Guide to The Standard for Project 
Management [1],1 changes to the PMBOK® Guide, the relationship to 
PMIstandards™ (PMI’s digital platform for standards), and provides a brief 
overview of the content.
1.1 Structure of the PMBOK® Guide
In addition to this Introduction, this edition of the PMBOK® Guide contains three sections:
▶ 	 Section 2 Project Performance Domains. This section identifies and describes eight project 
performance domains that form an integrated system to enable successful delivery of the project 
and intended outcomes.
▶ 	 Section 3 Tailoring. This section describes what tailoring is and presents an overview  
of what to tailor and how to go about tailoring individual projects.
▶ 	 Section 4 Models, Methods, and Artifacts. This section presents a brief description of commonly 
used models, methods, and artifacts. These models, methods, and artifacts illustrate the range of 
options project teams can use to produce deliverables, organize work, and enable communication 
and collaboration.

Guide.
Section 4 
Inputs and Outputs 
All of the inputs and outputs in this section appear in alphabetical order; therefore, no section 
numbers are assigned. 
Accepted deliverables. Accepted deliverables are the products, services, and capabilities that are 
created through a project and are validated by an appointed individual or a group of individuals 
against established criteria. When such criteria are met, the deliverables are approved and accepted. 
The authorized stakeholder who approves the deliverables should get involved early on in the 
process and provide feedback regarding the quality of the deliverables so that the team can assess 
quality and performance and recommend any necessary changes. 
Activity attributes. Activity attributes are multiple attributes associated with each schedule activity 
that can be included within the activity list. Activity attributes extend the description of the activity by 
identifying multiple components associated with each activity. 
The components for each activity evolve over time. During the initial stages of the project, they 
include the unique activity identifier (ID), work breakdown structure (WBS) ID, deliverables ID, and 
activity label or name. When completed, they may include activity descriptions, predecessor activities, 
successor activities, logical relationships, leads and lags, resource requirements, imposed dates, 
constraints, and assumptions. Activity attributes can be used to identify the place where the work 
should be performed, the project calendar the activity is assigned to, and the type of effort involved. 
Activity attributes are used for schedule development and for selecting, ordering, and sorting the 
planned schedule activities in various ways within reports.

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
Activity list. An activity list is a documented tabulation of schedule activities that shows the activity 
description, activity identifier, and a sufficiently detailed scope of work description so project team 
members understand what work is to be performed. 
Agreements. Agreements are any document or communication that defines the initial intentions of a 
project. These agreements can take the form of a contract, service-level agreement (SLA), memorandum 
of understanding (MOU), letters of agreement, verbal agreement, purchase order, email, etc. 
Agreements can be simple or complex. A complex project may involve multiple contracts 
simultaneously or in sequence. Agreements should comply with local, national, and international 
laws regarding contracts. 
Approved change requests. Approved change requests are change requests that were processed 
according to the change management plan by the project manager, change control board (CCB), or 
another designated person, and are either approved, deferred, or rejected. 
Approved change requests are implemented via the Manage Project Execution process. Deferred 
or rejected change requests are communicated to the person or group requesting the change. The 
dispositions of all change requests are recorded in the change log as a project document update. See 
also change requests. 
Approved changes. Approved changes are changes or modifications that are being implemented— 
or have been implemented—as part of the project scope. Approved changes result from change 
requests that have been fully approved through change control review meetings, either by the 
project manager or change control board (CCB). 
Assumption log. An assumption log is a project document used to record all assumptions and 
constraints throughout the project. New assumptions and constraints may be added, and the status 
of existing assumptions and constraints may be updated or closed out. 
High-level (strategic and operational) constraints are normally identified in the business case 
before the project is initiated and then flow into the project charter. Lower-level activity and task 
assumptions are generated throughout the project such as defining technical specifications, 
estimates, schedule activities, risks, etc. The assumption log is used to record all assumptions and 
constraints throughout the project life cycle. 
Backlog. A backlog is an ordered list of work to be done, often written as user stories, and prioritized 
by the business to manage and organize an adaptive or agile project’s work. The backlog reflects 
the current project needs, including the product requirements and user stories, and contains a 
reprioritized plan for the remaining work. 
The types of backlogs commonly used in adaptive and agile projects include the following: 
• 
Product backlog. Usually prepared by the product owner, the product backlog includes 
requirements, features, epic user stories, and user stories, representing the overall scope 
and vision of the product. 
• 
Iteration backlog. An iteration backlog is a subset of the product backlog that contains 
selected user stories and the required tasks to complete the committed work during the 
current iteration.

• 
Release backlog. A release backlog is a subset of the product backlog that includes items 
planned for a specific release. The release backlog helps organize the work to be delivered 
at the end of a release cycle, which may encompass multiple sprints or iterations. 
The project team determines the scope they can achieve based on the prioritized backlog, estimates 
the work involved, and works collaboratively throughout the iteration to develop the scope. 
Basis of estimates. The basis of estimates is the supporting documentation that outlines the details 
used in establishing the project estimates such as assumptions, constraints, levels of detail, ranges, 
and confidence levels. 
Regardless of the level of detail, the basis of estimates should provide a clear and complete 
understanding of how an estimate was derived. Documentation may include how the basis of 
estimate was developed, assumptions made, known constraints, range of possible estimates 
(e.g., ±10%), confidence level of the final estimate, and individual project risks influencing the estimate. 
Benefits management plan. The benefits management plan is the documented explanation defining 
the processes for creating, maximizing, and sustaining the benefits provided by a program or project. 
The benefits management plan is the document that describes how and when the benefits of the 
project will be delivered and the mechanisms that should be in place to measure those benefits. 
A project benefit is an outcome of actions, behaviors, products, services, or results that provides 
value to the sponsoring organization as well as to the project’s intended beneficiaries. Development 
of the plan begins early in the project life cycle with the definition of the target benefits. The plan 
describes key elements of the benefits and may include the following: 
• 
Target benefits. The expected tangible and intangible value to be gained by the 
implementation of the project; financial value may be expressed as net present value (NPV). 
• 
Strategic alignment. The alignment of the project to the business strategies of the organization. 
• 
Timeframe for realizing benefits. The length of time to realize benefits, for example, 
short term, long term, ongoing, or by phase. 
• 
Benefits owner. The person accountable for monitoring, recording, and reporting realized 
benefits throughout the timeframe established in the plan. 
• 
Metrics. The direct and indirect measures used to determine the benefits realized. 
• 
Assumptions. The factors expected to be in place or to be in evidence. 
• 
Risks. The risks that pertain to the realization of benefits. 
The data and information that are documented in the business case and needs assessment are 
used to develop the benefits management plan. The benefits management plan and the project 
management plan include a description of how the business value resulting from the project 
becomes part of the organization’s ongoing operations, including the metrics to be used. The metrics 
provide verification of the business value and validation of the project’s success. 
Development and maintenance of the benefits management plan is an iterative activity. The benefits 
management plan complements the business case, project charter, and project management plan. 
The project manager works with the sponsor to ensure that the project charter, project management 
plan, and benefits management plan remain in alignment throughout the life cycle of the project.

Both the business case and the benefits management plan are developed prior to the project 
being initiated. Additionally, both documents are referenced after the project has been completed. 
Therefore, they are considered business documents rather than project documents or components 
of the project management plan. As appropriate, these business documents may be inputs to some 
of the processes involved in managing the project, such as developing the project charter. 
Business case. A business case is a documented economic feasibility study used to establish validity 
of the benefits to be delivered by a portfolio component, program, or project. The business case 
helps to define a selected component that is lacking sufficient explanation and that is used as a basis 
for the authorization of further project management activities. 
The business case lists the objectives and reasons for project initiation. The business case helps to 
measure project success at the end of the project against the project objectives. The business case is 
a project business document that is used throughout the project life cycle. The business case may be 
used before project initiation and may result in a go/no-go decision for the project. 
Both the business case and the benefits management plan are developed prior to the project 
being initiated. Additionally, both documents are referenced after the project has been completed. 
Therefore, they are considered business documents rather than project documents or components 
of the project management plan. As appropriate, these business documents may be inputs to some 
of the processes involved in managing the project, such as developing the project charter. 
Business documents. Business documents include the business case and the benefits management plan; 
they contain information about the project’s objectives and how the project will contribute to the business 
goals. Although both documents are developed prior to the project, they are reviewed periodically. 
In some organizations, the business case and benefits management plan are maintained at the 
program level. The project sponsor is generally accountable for the development and maintenance 
of the project’s business case document. The project manager is responsible for providing 
recommendations and oversight to keep success measures for the project’s business case, project 
management plan, project charter, and benefits management plan in alignment with one another 
and with the goals and objectives of the organization. 
Change log. A change log is a comprehensive list of changes submitted during the project, which 
includes the current status of the submitted changes. The disposition of all change requests is 
recorded in the change log as a project document update. 
Change management plan. A change management plan is a component of the project management 
plan that establishes the change control board (CCB), also known as a steering committee; 
documents the extent of its authority; and describes how the change control system will be 
implemented. 
The change management plan provides the direction for managing the change control process and 
documents the roles and responsibilities of the CCB. 
Change requests. A change request is a formal proposal to modify a document, deliverable, or 
baseline. Change requests may be initiated internally or externally to the project. 
When issues are found while project work is being performed, change requests are submitted to 
modify project policies or procedures, project or product scope, project cost or budget, project 
schedule, or the quality of the project or product results. Change requests may include corrective

actions, preventive actions, defect repairs, or updates that reflect modified or additional ideas or 
content. Other change requests cover the needed preventive or corrective actions to eliminate or 
minimize a negative impact later in the project. 
Any stakeholder may request a change. Change requests are processed for review and disposition 
through the Assess and Implement Changes process. 
Communications management plan. The communications management plan is a component 
of the portfolio, program, or project management plan that describes how, when, and by whom 
information will be administered and disseminated. The communications management plan 
describes how project communications will be planned, structured, implemented, and monitored for 
effectiveness. The plan contains, but is not limited to, the following information: 
• 
Stakeholder communication requirements; 
• 
Information to be communicated, including language, format, content, and level of detail; 
• 
Escalation processes; 
• 
Reason for the distribution of that information; 
• 
Timeframe and frequency for the distribution of required information and receipt of 
acknowledgment or response, if applicable; 
• 
Person responsible for communicating the information; 
• 
Person responsible for authorizing release of confidential information; 
• 
Person or groups that will receive the information, including information about their needs, 
requirements, and expectations; 
• 
Methods or technologies used to convey the information, such as memos, emails, press 
releases, or social media announcements; 
• 
Resources allocated for communication activities, including time and budget; 
• 
Method for updating and refining the communications management plan as the project 
progresses and develops, such as when the stakeholder community changes as the project 
moves through different phases; 
• 
Glossary of common terminology; 
• 
Flowcharts of the information flow in the project, workflows with possible sequence of 
authorization, list of reports, meeting plans, etc.; and 
• 
Constraints derived from specific legislation or regulations, technologies, organizational 
policies, etc. 
The communications management plan may include guidelines and templates for project status 
meetings, project team meetings, virtual meetings, and email messages. The use of a project website 
and project management software can be included if these are to be used in the project. 
The communications management plan is both an input and an output that plays a crucial role in ensuring 
the smooth execution and delivery of a project. As an input, it serves as a guideline for the project team on 
how to disseminate information effectively. The communications management plan outlines: 
• 
Who needs to receive information (stakeholders, team members, etc.); 
• 
What information needs to be communicated (project updates, risks, changes, etc.);

• 
When and how often communication should occur (daily updates, weekly meetings, etc.); and 
• 
How the information will be delivered (emails, meetings, reports, etc.). 
As an output, the communications management plan is a dynamic document that evolves throughout 
the project life cycle. The communications management plan is regularly updated to reflect changes 
in project scope, stakeholder requirements, team structure, or the project environment. The plan 
helps ensure that all parties are kept informed and that the project remains transparent and on track. 
Communications management plan updates. Communications management plan updates refer 
to the process of revising and enhancing the existing communications management plan to reflect 
the current needs and status of the project. The update is a critical component that helps ensure all 
stakeholders are kept informed and engaged throughout the project life cycle. 
Component. A component is a predetermined element of a portfolio, program, or project that is 
work related to the achievement of the strategic objectives of the portfolio, program, or project. 
Various components interrelate with one another during the process of project management. 
Configuration management plan. A component of the project management plan, the configuration 
management plan is a collection of procedures used to track project artifacts and monitor and control 
changes to these artifacts. The plan describes how to identify and account for project artifacts under 
configuration control as well as how to record and report changes to them. The configuration management 
plan describes how the information about the items of the project (and which items) will be recorded and 
updated so that the product, service, or result of the project remains consistent and/or operative. 
Cost baseline. The cost baseline is the approved version of the time-phased project budget, 
excluding any management reserves, which can be changed only through formal change control 
procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results. 
Cost baseline updates. Cost baseline updates involve revising the approved budget to accommodate 
changes that impact on the project’s financials. These updates are a critical aspect of cost control and 
help ensure that the project remains financially viable. Updates can occur during inputs and outputs. 
Inputs: 
• 
Approved project budget. The original cost baseline against which performance is 
measured. 
• 
Change requests. Formal proposals for changes that affect the project’s scope, schedule, 
or cost. 
• 
Actual costs. The real expenses incurred during project execution. 
• 
Project management plan. The guiding document that includes the financial management 
plan. 
Outputs: 
• 
Revised cost baseline. An updated version of the cost baseline that reflects the approved 
changes. 
• 
Updated cost estimates. New cost projections based on changes to the project scope or 
resources.

--- Page 224 ---

 
 
• 
Budget forecasts. Predictions of future project expenditures based on current data. 
• 
Change log. Documentation of all changes made to the cost baseline. 
Cost estimates. A cost estimate is a quantitative assessment of the likely costs for resources required 
to complete an activity. The cost estimate is a prediction that is based on the information known at a 
given point in time. Cost estimates include the identification and consideration of costing alternatives to 
initiate and complete the project. Cost trade-offs and risks should be considered, such as make versus 
buy, buy versus lease, and the sharing of resources in order to achieve optimal costs for the project. 
Cost estimates are generally expressed in units of some currency (e.g., dollars, euros, yen, etc.). In 
some instances, other units of measure, such as staff hours or staff days, may be used to facilitate 
comparisons by eliminating the effects of currency fluctuations. 
Cost estimates should be reviewed and refined during the course of the project to reflect additional 
details as they become available and assumptions are tested. The accuracy of a project estimate will 
increase as the project progresses through the project life cycle. 
Costs are estimated for all resources that will be charged to the project. These resources include but 
are not limited to labor, materials, equipment, services, and facilities, as well as special categories 
such as an inflation allowance, cost of financing, or contingency costs. Cost estimates may be 
presented at the activity level or in summary form. 
Cost forecasts. Based on the project’s past performance, cost forecasts are used to determine if the 
project is within defined tolerance ranges for the budget and to identify any necessary change requests. 
A calculated estimate at completion (EAC) value is documented and communicated to stakeholders. 
Deliverable. A deliverable is any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform 
a service that is required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Projects are 
undertaken to fulfill objectives by producing deliverables. Deliverables may be tangible or intangible. 
Development approach. The development approach is the method used to create and evolve the 
product, service, or result during the project life cycle, such as an adaptive, predictive, or hybrid method. 
Duration estimates. Duration estimates are quantitative assessments of the likely number of 
time periods that are required to complete an activity, phase, or project. Duration estimates do not 
include any lags. Duration estimates may include some indication of the range of possible results. 
For example: 
• 
A range of 2 weeks ± 2 days, which indicates that the activity will take at least 8 days and not 
more than 12 (assuming a 5-day work week); or 
• 
A 15% probability of exceeding 3 weeks, which indicates a high probability—85%—that the 
activity will take 3 weeks or less. 
Enterprise environmental factors (EEFs). Enterprise environmental factors are conditions, 
not under the immediate control of the team, that influence, constrain, or direct the portfolio, 
program, or project. These conditions can be internal and/or external to the organization. The EEFs 
are considered as inputs to many project management processes, specifically for most planning 
processes. These factors may enhance or constrain project management options. In addition, these 
factors may have a positive or negative influence on the outcome.

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
 
EEFs internal to the organization: 
• 
Organizational culture, structure, and governance. Examples include vision, mission, 
values, beliefs, cultural norms, leadership style, hierarchy and authority relationships, 
organizational style, ethics, codes of conduct, policies, and procedures. 
• 
Geographic distribution of facilities and resources. Examples include factory locations 
and virtual teams. 
• 
Infrastructure. Examples include existing facilities, equipment, organizational 
telecommunications channels, information technology hardware, availability, and capacity. 
• 
Information technology software. Examples include scheduling software tools, 
configuration management systems, web interfaces to other online automated systems, 
and work authorization systems. 
• 
Resource availability. Examples include contracting and purchasing constraints, approved 
providers and subcontractors, and collaboration agreements. 
• 
Employee capability. Examples include existing human resources expertise, skills, 
competencies, and specialized knowledge. 
EEFs external to the organization: 
• 
Marketplace conditions. Examples include competitors, market share, brand recognition, 
and trademarks. 
• 
Social and cultural influences and issues. Examples include political climate, codes of 
conduct, ethics, and perceptions. 
• 
Legal restrictions. Examples include country or local laws and regulations related to 
security, data protection, business conduct, employment, and procurement. 
• 
Commercial databases. Examples include benchmarking results, standardized cost 
estimating data, industry risk study information, and risk databases. 
• 
Academic research. Examples include industry studies, publications, and benchmarking 
results. 
• 
Government or industry standards. Examples include regulatory agency regulations and 
standards related to products, production, environment, quality, and workmanship. 
• 
Financial considerations. Examples include currency exchange rates, interest rates, 
inflation rates, tariffs, and geographic location. 
• 
Physical environmental elements. Examples include working conditions and weather 
constraints. 
Enterprise environmental factor updates. Enterprise environmental factor (EEF) updates refer 
to modifications or changes made to the conditions that influence, constrain, or direct a project. 
These factors can be internal or external to the organization and are not under the control of the 
project team. Updates to EEFs are important as they can enhance or constrain project management 
options and have a positive or negative influence on the project’s outcome. Understanding and 
updating EEFs is essential for effective project management. 
Final product, service, or result transition. A product, service, or result, once delivered by the 
project, may be handed over to a different group or organization that will operate, maintain, and

support it throughout its life cycle. This output refers to the transition of the final product, service, or 
result that the project was authorized to produce (or in the case of phase closure, the intermediate 
product, service, or result of that phase) from one team to another. 
Final report. A final report is a summary of project performance, which can include information such as: 
• 
Summary-level description of the project or phase; 
• 
Scope objectives, the criteria used to evaluate the scope, and evidence that the completion 
criteria were met; 
• 
Quality objectives, the criteria used to evaluate the project and product quality, the 
verification and actual milestone delivery dates, and reasons for variances; 
• 
Cost objectives, including the acceptable cost range, actual costs, and reasons for any 
variances; 
• 
Summary of the validation information for the final product, service, or result; 
• 
Schedule objectives, including whether the results achieved the benefits that the project 
was undertaken to address (If the benefits are not met at the close of the project, indicate 
the degree to which they were achieved and an estimate for future benefits realization.); 
• 
Summary of how the final product, service, or result achieved the business needs identified 
in the business plan (If the business needs are not met at the close of the project, indicate 
the degree to which they were achieved and an estimate for when the business needs will 
be met in the future.); and 
• 
Summary of any risks or issues encountered on the project and how they were addressed. 
Financial management plan. A financial management plan is a component of a program or project 
management plan that describes how costs will be planned, structured, and controlled. The financial 
management processes, and their associated tools and techniques, are documented in the financial 
management plan. For example, the financial management plan can establish the following: 
• 
Units of measure. Each unit used in measurements (e.g., staff hours, staff days, or weeks 
for time measures; meters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures; or 
lump sum in currency form) is defined for each of the resources. 
• 
Level of precision. This is the degree to which cost estimates will be rounded up or down 
(e.g., US$995.59 to US$1,000) based on the scope of the activities and magnitude of 
the project. 
• 
Level of accuracy. The acceptable range (e.g., ±10%) used in determining realistic cost 
estimates is specified and may include an amount for contingencies. 
• 
Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (see Section 5) 
provides the framework for the financial management plan, allowing for consistency with 
the estimates, budgets, and control of costs. The WBS component used for project cost 
accounting is called the control account. Each control account is assigned a unique code or 
account number(s) that links directly to the performing organization’s accounting system. 
• 
Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring cost performance may be 
specified to indicate an agreed-upon amount of variation to be allowed before some action 
should be taken. Thresholds are typically expressed as percentage deviations from the 
baseline plan.

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
• 
Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules of 
performance measurement are set. For example, the financial management plan may: 
◾ 
Define the points in the WBS at which measurement of control accounts will be 
performed; 
◾ 
Establish the EVM techniques (e.g., weighted milestones, fixed formula, percent 
complete, etc.) to be employed; and 
◾ 
Specify tracking methodologies and the EVM computation equations for calculating 
the projected estimate at completion (EAC) forecasts to provide a validity check on the 
bottom-up EAC. 
• 
Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various cost reports are defined. 
• 
Additional details. Additional details about financial management activities include but are 
not limited to: 
◾ 
Description of strategic funding choices, 
◾ 
Procedure to account for fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and 
◾ 
Procedure for project cost recording. 
Funding proposals. Projects often require dedicated funding efforts either before or after the 
projects have started. Additionally, certain phases of a given project may require specific funding 
requests to cover approved budgets associated with that phase. In these cases, estimated costs and 
reserves are calculated as part of a business value proposition. The value proposition is then used to 
request the needed funds from the appropriate internal or external funding source. 
Funding strategy. Projects require funding to be successful. Funding can come from sources either 
internal or external to the project’s performing organization. Some projects require more than one 
approach to secure the needed monies. Any single approach, or combination of approaches, can be 
considered a funding strategy. Approaches range from organizational budget transfers to customer 
contracts to government or nongovernmental organization (NGO) grants. Common funding strategies 
include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
Fixed or reallocated internal budgets. Internally owned assets and employees are 
funded by fixed annual departmental budgets and then applied to specific projects as 
needed. Alternatively, existing budgets within the organization that have surplus funds 
or lower-priority initiatives can be reallocated to the project. 
• 
Lump sum. The entirety of the project’s budget and reserves are allocated all at once. 
• 
Incremental disbursement. Project funds are secured and allocated in multiple 
increments, specific to individual phases or key milestones. 
• 
External investment. This strategy involves high-net-worth individual or institutional 
investors who are willing to provide capital to early-stage or innovative projects, often in 
exchange for interest in long-term ownership or operations. 
• 
Governmental or nongovernmental organization (NGO) grants. Projects may be 
partially or fully funded by relevant grants offered by government agencies, NGOs, or 
philanthropists that support projects aligning with their specific objectives. 
• 
Crowdfunding. This strategy involves the accumulation of small contributions from a 
large number of individuals who are interested in supporting the project or its mission. 
This strategy can be particularly effective for projects with strong community appeal.

• 
Client contract. Many projects are the result of a customer procurement effort, where the 
performing organization serves as a vendor to a sponsor organization. Procurement is a 
complementary discipline to project management and is further explored in Appendix X4. 
Issue log. An issue log is a project document where information about issues is recorded and monitored. 
Lessons learned register. A lessons learned register is a project document or repository used to 
record knowledge gained during a project, phase, or iteration so that it can be used to improve future 
performance for the team and the organization. Lessons learned from previous projects can be used 
in the current project and entered into the lessons learned repository. 
The lessons learned register may include the category and description of the situation. The register 
may also include the impacts, recommendations, and proposed actions associated with the situation. 
The lessons learned register records challenges, problems, realized risks and opportunities, or other 
content as appropriate. 
The lessons learned register is created as an output of the Manage Project Knowledge process 
early in the project. Thereafter it is used as an input and updated as an output in many processes 
throughout the project. The persons or teams involved in the work are also involved in capturing 
the lessons learned. Knowledge can be documented using videos, pictures, audio, or other suitable 
means that ensure the efficiency of the lessons captured. 
At the end of a project or phase, the information is transferred to an organizational process asset 
called a lessons learned repository. 
Lessons learned updates. Lessons learned updates refer to the process of capturing, documenting, 
and integrating knowledge gained during a project to improve future performance. This effort 
involves identifying what went well, what did not, and how similar situations can be better managed 
in future projects. 
Make-or-buy analysis and decisions. Make-or-buy analysis is the decision-making process of 
gathering and organizing data about product requirements and analyzing them against available 
alternatives, including the purchase or internal manufacture of the product. A make-or-buy analysis 
results in a make-or-buy decision as to whether particular work can be best accomplished by the 
project team or if it should be purchased from outside sources. 
Milestone list. A milestone list identifies all of the project milestones and indicates whether the 
milestone is mandatory, such as those required by contract, or optional, such as those based on historical 
information. Milestones have zero duration because they represent a significant point or event in a project. 
Organizational capabilities. Organizational capabilities include all of the organizational policies, 
ways of working, reporting structures, and attitudes that should be aligned to employ adaptive 
methods successfully, as organizational capabilities influence the development approach. 
Transitioning from predictive development approaches to adaptive approaches and then to 
using agile methods is more than just stating that the organization has now become agile. The 
transition entails shifting the mindset starting at the executive level and continuing throughout the 
organization, as well as promoting and sustaining ongoing efforts to stay agile. 
Organizational process assets (OPAs). Organizational process assets are plans, processes, policies, 
procedures, regulations, and knowledge bases specific to and used by the performing organization. 
These assets influence the management of the project.

The OPAs include any artifact, practice, or knowledge from any or all of the performing organizations 
involved in the project that can be used to execute or govern the project. The OPAs also include 
the organization’s lessons learned from previous projects and historical information. Additionally, 
OPAs may include completed schedules, risk data, and earned value data. The OPAs are inputs to 
many project management processes. Since OPAs are internal to the organization, the project team 
members may be able to update and add to them as necessary throughout the project. A project’s 
OPAs may be grouped into two categories: 
• 
Processes, documents, and templates. Generally, assets in this category are not updated 
as part of the project work. Processes, documents, and templates are usually established 
by the project management office (PMO) or another function outside of the project. These 
assets can be updated only by following the appropriate organizational policies associated 
with updating them. Some organizations encourage the team to tailor templates, life cycles, 
and checklists for the project. In these instances, the project management team should 
tailor those assets to meet the needs of the project. 
• 
Organizational knowledge repositories. Assets in this category are updated throughout 
the project with project information. For example, information on financial performance, 
lessons learned, performance metrics and issues, and defects are continually updated 
throughout the project. 
Organizational process asset (OPA) updates. Any OPA can be updated as a result of a process. 
Updates include plans, processes, and knowledge repositories specific to and used by the performing 
organization. 
Outputs from other processes. Outputs from other processes are integrated to create the project 
management plan. Subsidiary plans and baselines that are outputs from other processes are inputs 
to this process. In addition, changes to these documents may necessitate updates to the project 
management plan. 
Performance measurement baseline (PMB). The performance measurement baseline includes the 
integrated scope, schedule, and cost baselines used for comparison to manage, measure, and control 
project execution. 
Physical or virtual resource assignments. The physical and virtual resource assignments document 
the materials, equipment, supplies, locations, and other physical resources, as well as digital tools, 
remote team members, and virtual assets that will be utilized during the project. This documentation 
describes the expected resource utilization and whether the resource is internal to the organization, 
outsourced, or remotely engaged. Physical and virtual resource assignments are dynamic and subject to 
change due to availability, project needs, organizational requirements, the environment, or other factors. 
Procurement documentation. Procurement documentation includes all of the documents used in 
signing, executing, and closing an agreement. Procurement documentation may include documents 
predating the project. This documentation contains the complete supporting records for administration of 
the procurement processes. Procurement documentation includes the statement of work (SOW), payment 
information, contractor work performance information, plans, drawings, and other correspondence. 
Procurement management plan. The procurement management plan is a component of the 
program or project management plan that describes how a team will acquire goods and services 
from outside of the performing organization.

The procurement management plan contains the activities to be undertaken during the procurement 
process. The plan should document whether international competitive bidding, national competitive 
bidding, local bidding, etc., should be done. If the project is financed externally, the sources and availability 
of funding should be aligned with the procurement management plan and the project schedule. 
The procurement management plan may include guidance for the following: 
• 
How procurement will be coordinated with other project aspects such as project schedule 
development and control processes; 
• 
Timetable of key procurement activities; 
• 
Procurement metrics to be used to manage contracts; 
• 
Stakeholder roles and responsibilities related to procurement, including authority and 
constraints of the project team when the performing organization has a procurement 
department; 
• 
Constraints and assumptions that could affect planned procurements; 
• 
Legal jurisdiction and the currency in which payments will be made; 
• 
Determination of whether independent estimates will be used and whether they are 
needed as evaluation criteria; 
• 
Risk management issues, including identifying requirements for performance bonds or 
insurance contracts to mitigate some forms of project risk; and 
• 
Prequalified sellers, if any, to be used. 
A procurement management plan can be formal or informal, highly detailed or broadly framed, and 
is based upon the needs of each project. 
Product. An artifact that is produced, is quantifiable, and can be either an end item in itself or a 
component item. Product is an overarching term that includes both tangible (physical goods) and 
intangible (digital goods and services) items. 
Project calendars. A project calendar is a calendar that identifies working days and shifts that are 
available for scheduled activities. The project calendar distinguishes time periods in days, or parts 
of days, that are available to complete scheduled activities from time periods that are not available 
for work. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar to allow for different work 
periods for some activities to calculate the project schedule. Project calendars may be updated. 
Project charter. A project charter is a document issued by the project initiator or sponsor that 
formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to 
apply organizational resources to project activities. 
Project communications. Project communications may include but are not limited to performance 
reports, deliverable status, schedule progress, cost incurred, presentations, and other information 
required by stakeholders. 
Project documents. The project documents include documentation created throughout the five 
Project Management Focus Areas to initiate, plan, execute, monitor and control, and close the project 
before delivering it. Examples include the change log, issue log, project schedule, project scope 
statement, requirements documentation, risk register, and stakeholder register.

Project document updates. The project document updates include updates to the project 
documents created throughout the five Project Management Focus Areas to initiate, plan, execute, 
monitor and control, and close the project before delivering it. 
Project funding requirements. The project funding requirements are the total funding 
requirements and periodic funding requirements (e.g., quarterly, annually) that are derived from the 
cost baseline. The cost baseline includes the projected expenditures plus the contingency reserves. 
Funding often occurs in incremental amounts and may not be evenly distributed (see Figure 4-1). 
The total funds required are those included in the cost baseline plus management reserves, if any. 
Funding requirements may include the source(s) of the funding. The budget at completion (BAC) is 
the sum of all budgets established for the work to be performed. 
Project management plan. The project management plan is the document that describes how the 
project will be executed, monitored and controlled, and closed. The project management plan defines 
the basis for all project decisions and is a living document that can be expected to change over time. 
A project management plan typically consists of the following components: change management 
plan, communications management plan, financial management plan, iteration plan, procurement 
management plan, quality management plan, requirements management plan, release plan, 
resource management plan, risk management plan, schedule management plan, scope management 
plan, sourcing strategy plan, stakeholder engagement plan, and test plan. However, the project 
team or the organization may tailor the content of the project management plan to include only 
those elements that are most relevant to the specific project context, objectives, and organizational 
requirements.

Project management plan updates. Project management plan updates are updates to the 
document that describes how the project is being executed, monitored and controlled, and closed. 
Project schedule. The project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked 
activities with planned dates, durations, milestones, and resources. The detailed project 
schedule should be flexible throughout the project to adjust for the knowledge gained, increased 
understanding of the risks, and value-added activities. 
Project schedule network diagram. The project schedule network diagram is a graphical 
representation of the logical relationships among the project schedule activities. Logical 
relationships may also be referred to as dependencies. Figure 4-2 illustrates a project schedule 
network diagram. A project schedule network diagram is produced manually or by using project 
management software. The diagram may include full project details or may have one or more 
summary activities. A summary narrative can accompany the diagram and describe the basic 
approach used to sequence the activities. Any unusual activity sequences within the network should 
be fully described within the narrative. 
Activities that have multiple predecessor activities indicate a path convergence. Activities that have 
multiple successor activities indicate a path divergence. Activities with divergence and convergence 
are at greater risk as they are affected by multiple activities or can affect multiple activities. Activity I 
is called a path convergence, as it has more than one predecessor, while activity K is called a path 
divergence, as it has more than one successor.

Project scope statement. The project scope statement is the description of the project scope, 
major deliverables, assumptions, and constraints. The project scope statement documents the entire 
scope, including the project and product scope. The statement describes the project’s deliverables in 
detail and provides a common understanding of the project scope among project stakeholders. The 
document may contain explicit scope exclusions that can assist in managing stakeholder expectations. 
The project scope statement enables the project team to perform more detailed planning, guides the 
project team’s work during execution, and provides the baseline for evaluating whether requests for 
changes or additional work are contained within or outside the project’s boundaries. 
The degree and level of detail to which the project scope statement defines the work that will be 
performed and the work that is excluded can help determine how well the project management 
team can control the overall project scope. The detailed project scope statement, either directly or by 
reference to other documents, includes the following: 
• 
Project scope description. The project scope description progressively elaborates the 
characteristics of the product, service, or result described in the project charter and 
requirements documentation. 
• 
Deliverables. A deliverable is any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability 
to perform a service that is required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or 
project. Deliverables also include ancillary results such as project management reports and 
documentation. These deliverables may be described at a summary level or in great detail. 
• 
Acceptance criteria. The acceptance criteria is a set of conditions that are met before 
deliverables are accepted. 
• 
Project exclusions. Project exclusions identify what is excluded from the project. Explicitly 
stating what is out of scope for the project helps manage stakeholders’ expectations and 
can reduce scope creep. 
Although the project charter and the project scope statement are sometimes perceived as containing 
a certain degree of redundancy, they are different in the level of detail contained in each. The project 
charter contains high-level information, while the project scope statement contains a detailed 
description of the scope components. These components are progressively elaborated throughout 
the project. Table 4-1 describes some of the key elements for each document. 
Project team assignments. Project team assignments are recorded in a document containing a list 
of the team members and their roles and responsibilities for the project. This documentation can 
include a project team directory and names inserted into the project management plan, such as the 
project organization charts and schedules. 
Quality control measurements. Quality control measurements are the documented results of the 
Manage Quality Assurance process activities. The measurements should be captured in the format 
specified in the quality management plan. 
Quality management plan. The quality management plan is a component of the program or project 
management plan that describes how an organization’s policies, procedures, and guidelines will 
be implemented to achieve the quality objectives. The plan describes the activities and resources 
necessary for the project management team to achieve the quality objectives set for the project. The 
quality management plan may be formal or informal, detailed or broadly framed. The style and detail 
of the quality management plan are determined by the requirements of the project. The plan should

be reviewed early in the project to ensure that decisions are based on accurate information. The 
benefits of this review may include a sharper focus on the project’s value proposition, reductions in 
costs, and less frequent schedule overruns that are caused by rework. 
The quality management plan may include but is not limited to the following components: 
• 
Quality standards that will be used by the project; 
• 
Quality objectives of the project; 
• 
Quality roles and responsibilities; 
• 
Project deliverables and processes subject to quality reviews; 
• 
Quality control and quality management activities planned for the project; and 
• 
Quality tools and methodologies to be employed, alongside detailed procedures for 
handling nonconformance and continuous improvement. 
Quality metrics. Quality metrics specifically describe project or product attributes and how the 
Manage Quality Assurance process will verify compliance with them. Some examples of quality 
metrics include percentage of tasks completed on time, cost performance measured by a cost 
performance index (CPI), failure rates, number of defects identified per day, total downtime per 
month, errors found per line of code, customer satisfaction scores, and percentage of requirements 
covered by the test plan as a measure of test coverage. 
Quality reports. A quality report is a project document that includes quality management issues, 
recommendations for corrective actions, and a summary of findings from quality control activities.

The quality report may include recommendations for any process, project, and product 
improvements. 
Quality test and evaluation documents. Quality test and evaluation documents are essential 
components in project management that are designed to ensure a product or service meets the 
specified quality objectives. These documents outline the activities and processes used to assess 
whether the deliverables align with the quality standards set in the quality management plan. The 
quality test and evaluation documents are crucial for identifying errors, defects, or nonconformance 
issues early in the project life cycle, thereby reducing the cost and effort required to address the 
issues later. 
Regulations. See organizational process assets (OPAs). 
Requirements documentation. Requirements documentation is a description of how individual 
requirements should meet the business needs of the project. Requirements may start out at a 
high level and become progressively more detailed as more information about the requirements 
becomes known. Before being baselined, requirements should be unambiguous (measurable and 
testable), traceable, complete, consistent, and acceptable to key stakeholders. The format of the 
requirements documentation may range from a simple document listing all of the requirements 
categorized by stakeholder and priority, to more elaborate forms containing an executive summary, 
detailed descriptions, and attachments. The documentation may also include static or dynamic 
graphic information. 
Many organizations categorize requirements into different types such as business and technical. 
Business requirements refer to stakeholder needs and technical requirements determine how 
those needs will be implemented. Requirements can be grouped into classifications allowing for 
further refinement and detail as the requirements are elaborated. These classifications may include 
the following: 
• 
Business requirements. These requirements outline the strategic objectives and high-level 
needs of the organization, ensuring alignment with broader organizational goals. 
• 
Stakeholder requirements. These requirements describe the needs of a stakeholder or 
stakeholder group. 
• 
Solution requirements. These requirements describe the features, functions, and 
characteristics of the product, service, or result that will meet the business and stakeholder 
needs. Solution requirements are further grouped into functional and nonfunctional 
requirements: 
◾ 
Functional requirements. Functional requirements describe the behaviors of the 
product. Examples include actions, processes, data, and interactions that the product 
should execute. 
◾ 
Nonfunctional requirements. Nonfunctional requirements complement functional 
requirements by specifying performance, security, and operational criteria essential 
for product effectiveness and user satisfaction. Examples include reliability, security, 
performance, safety, level of service, supportability, retention/purge, etc. 
• 
Transition and readiness requirements. These requirements describe temporary 
capabilities, such as data conversion and training requirements, needed to transition from 
the current, as-is state to the desired future state.

• 
Project requirements. These requirements describe the actions, processes, or other 
conditions the project should meet. Examples include milestone dates, contractual 
obligations, constraints, etc. 
• 
Quality requirements. These requirements capture any condition or criteria required to 
validate the successful completion of a project deliverable or fulfillment of other project 
requirements. Examples include tests, certifications, validations, etc. 
Requirements management plan. A requirements management plan is a component of 
the program or project management plan that describes how requirements will be analyzed, 
documented, and managed. According to Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide [2], some 
organizations refer to the requirements management plan as a business analysis plan. Components 
of the requirements management plan may include but are not limited to the following: 
• 
How requirements activities will be planned, tracked, and reported; 
• 
Configuration management activities such as: 
◾ 
How changes will be initiated; 
◾ 
How impacts will be analyzed; 
◾ 
How changes will be traced, tracked, and reported; and 
◾ 
Authorization levels required to approve these changes. 
• 
Requirements prioritization process; 
• 
Metrics that will be used and the rationale for using them; and 
• 
Traceability structure that reflects the requirement attributes captured on the requirements 
traceability matrix. 
Requirements traceability matrix. The requirements traceability matrix is a grid that links product 
requirements from their origin to the deliverables that satisfy them. The implementation of a requirements 
traceability matrix helps to ensure that each requirement adds business value by linking it to the business 
and project objectives. The matrix provides a means to track requirements throughout the project life 
cycle, helping to ensure that requirements approved in the requirements documentation are delivered at 
the end of the project. Finally, it provides a structure for managing changes to the product scope. 
The requirements traceability matrix includes but is not limited to the following: 
• 
Business needs, opportunities, goals, and objectives; 
• 
Project objectives; 
• 
Project scope and WBS deliverables; 
• 
Product design; 
• 
Product development; 
• 
Test strategy and test scenarios; and 
• 
High-level requirements to more detailed requirements. 
Attributes associated with each requirement can be recorded in the requirements traceability 
matrix. These attributes help to define key information about the requirement. Typical attributes

Figure 4-3. Example of a Requirements Traceability Matrix 
used in the requirements traceability matrix may include a unique identifier, a textual description 
of the requirement, the rationale for inclusion, the owner, source, priority, version, current status 
(e.g., active, canceled, deferred, added, approved, assigned, completed), and status date. Additional 
attributes to help ensure that the requirement has met stakeholder satisfaction may include stability, 
complexity, and acceptance criteria. Figure 4-3 provides an example of a requirements traceability 
matrix with its associated attributes. 
Resource breakdown structure. A resource breakdown structure is a hierarchical representation of 
resources by category and type. Examples of resource categories include but are not limited to labor, 
materials, equipment, and supplies. Resource types may include the skill level, grade level, required 
certifications, or other information as appropriate to the project. See Figure 4-4 for an example. 
Resource calendar. A resource calendar is a calendar that identifies the working days and 
shifts during which each specific resource is available. The calendar should include the start and 
end of normal business hours, weekends, and public holidays when each specific resource is 
available. Information on which resources (such as team resources, equipment, and materials) are 
potentially available during a planned activity period is used for estimating resource utilization. 
Resource calendars also specify when, and for how long, identified team and physical or virtual 
resources will be available during the project. This information may be at the activity or project 
level. This calendar may include consideration of attributes such as resource experience and/or 
skill level, as well as various geographical locations. 
Resource management plan. A resource management plan is a component of the project management 
plan that describes how project resources are acquired, allocated, monitored, and controlled. The plan

may be divided between the team management plan and the physical resource management plan 
according to the specifics of the project. 
The resource management plan may include but is not limited to the following: 
• 
Identification of resources. Methods for identifying and quantifying the team and physical 
resources needed. 
• 
Acquiring resources. Guidance on how to acquire the team and physical resources for the 
project. 
• 
Roles and responsibilities: 
◾ 
Role. The function assumed by, or assigned to, a person in the project. Examples of 
project roles are civil engineer, business analyst, and testing coordinator. 
◾ 
Authority. The right to apply project resources, make decisions, sign approvals, accept 
deliverables, and influence others to carry out the work of the project. Examples 
of decisions that should have clear authority include the selection of a method for 
completing an activity, quality acceptance criteria, and how to respond to project 
variances. Team members operate best when their individual levels of authority match 
their individual responsibilities. 
◾ 
Responsibility. The assigned duties and work that a project team member is expected 
to perform in order to complete the project’s activities. 
◾ 
Competence. The skill and capacity required to complete assigned activities within the 
project constraints. If project team members do not possess required competencies, 
performance can be jeopardized. When such mismatches are identified, proactive 
responses such as training, hiring, schedule changes, or scope changes are initiated.

• 
Risk strategy. The risk strategy describes the general approach to managing risk on a project. 
• 
Methodology. The methodology defines the specific approaches, tools, and data sources 
that will be used to perform risk management on a project. 
• 
Roles and responsibilities. The roles and responsibilities define the lead, support, and risk 
management team members for each type of activity described in the risk management 
plan and help to clarify their responsibilities. 
• 
Funding. Funding identifies the funds needed to perform activities related to the 
management of risk. Funding also establishes protocols for the application of contingency 
and management reserves. 
• 
Timing. Timing defines when and how often the risk processes will be performed 
throughout the project life cycle and establishes risk management activities for inclusion in 
the project schedule. 
• 
Project organization charts. A project organization chart is a graphical display of project 
team members and their reporting relationships. The chart can be formal or informal, 
highly detailed or broadly framed, based on the needs of the project. For example, the 
project organization chart for a 3,000-person disaster response team should have greater 
detail than a project organization chart for an internal, 20-person project. 
• 
Project team resource management. Guidance on how the project team resources 
should be defined, staffed, managed, and eventually released. 
• 
Training. Training strategies for team members. 
• 
Team development. Methods for developing the project team. 
• 
Resource control. Methods for ensuring adequate physical resources are available as 
needed and that the acquisition of physical resources is optimized for project needs. The 
resource control includes information on managing inventory, equipment, and supplies 
throughout the project life cycle. 
• 
Recognition plan. A plan for which recognitions and rewards will be given to team 
members, and when they will be given. 
Resource requirements. Resource requirements identify the types and quantities of resources 
required for each work package or activity in a work package and can be aggregated to determine the 
estimated resources for each work package, each WBS branch, and the entire project. The amount 
of detail and the level of specificity of the resource requirement descriptions can vary by application 
area. The resource requirements documentation may include assumptions made in determining 
which types of resources should be applied, their availability, and what quantities are needed. 
Revenue forecasts. Revenue forecasts are projections of the future financial performance of an 
organization or project, specifically focusing on the expected income generated from sales or services 
over a certain period. These forecasts are crucial for strategic planning, budgeting, and decision-
making processes as they provide insights into potential financial outcomes and help in managing 
resources effectively. 
Risk management plan. The risk management plan is a component of the project management plan 
and describes how risk management activities will be structured and performed. 
The risk management plan may include some or all of the following elements:

• 
Risk categories. Risk categories provide a means for grouping individual project risks. 
A common way to structure risk categories is with a risk breakdown structure (RBS), which 
is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk (see an example in Figure 4-5). 
An RBS helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual 
project risks may arise. This view can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing 
identified risks. The organization may have a generic RBS to be used for all projects,

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
 
there may be several RBS frameworks for different types of projects, or the project may 
develop a tailored RBS. Where an RBS is not used, an organization may use a custom 
risk categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a 
structure based on project objectives. 
• 
Stakeholder risk appetite. The risk appetites of key stakeholders on the project are 
recorded in the risk management plan, as they inform the details of the Plan Risk 
Management process. Stakeholder risk appetite should be expressed as measurable 
risk thresholds around each project objective. These thresholds should determine the 
acceptable level of overall project risk exposure, and they are also used to inform the 
definitions of probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual 
project risks. 
• 
Definitions of risk probability and impacts. Definitions of risk probability and impact 
levels are specific to the project context and reflect the risk appetite and thresholds of 
the organization and key stakeholders. The project may generate specific definitions of 
probability and impact levels, or it may start with general definitions provided by the 
organization. The number of levels reflects the degree of detail required for the risk 
process, with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach (typically five levels), 
and fewer for a simple process (usually three levels). Table 4-2 provides an example of 
definitions of probability and impacts against three project objectives. These scales can 
be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact definitions 
as negative for threats (delay, additional cost, and performance shortfall) and positive for 
opportunities (reduced time or cost and performance enhancement). While most risks can 
be mapped into the probability and impact scales, it is important to be mindful that there 
may be risks such as ethical risks or those that may impact the organization’s reputation, 
team morale, or other intangible factors.

Risk register. A risk register is a repository in which outputs of risk management processes are recorded. 
The risk register captures details of identified individual project risks. The results of the following 
processes are recorded in the risk register as these processes are conducted throughout the project: 
• 
Identify Risks, 
• 
Perform Risk Analysis, 
• 
Plan Risk Responses, 
• 
Implement Risk Responses, and 
• 
Monitor Risks. 
The risk register may contain limited or extensive risk information depending on project variables 
such as size and complexity. 
When the Identify Risks process is performed, the content of the risk register may include but is not 
limited to the following: 
• 
List of identified risks. Each individual project risk is given a unique identifier in the risk 
register. Identified risks are described in as much detail as required to ensure unambiguous 
understanding. A structured risk statement may be used to distinguish risks from their 
cause(s) and their effect(s). 
• 
Potential risk owners. Where a potential risk owner has been identified during the Identify 
Risks process, the risk owner is recorded in the risk register. This information will be 
confirmed during the Perform Risk Analysis process. 
• 
List of potential risk responses. Where a potential risk response has been identified 
during the Identify Risks process, it is recorded in the risk register. This information will be 
confirmed during the Plan Risk Responses process. 
Additional data may be recorded for each identified risk, depending on the risk register format 
specified in the risk management plan. This may include the following: 
• 
Short risk title, 
• 
Risk category, 
• 
Current risk status, 
• 
One or more causes, 
• 
One or more effects on objectives, 
• 
Risk triggers (events or conditions that indicate that a risk is about to occur), 
• 
WBS reference of affected activities, and 
• 
Timing information (when a risk was identified, when a risk might occur, when a risk may no 
longer be relevant, and the deadline for taking action). 
Risk register updates. The risk register updates refer to the process of revising the risk register to 
reflect new risks, reassess existing risks, and update response strategies as the project progresses. 
Risk register updates are a key component of risk management that help to ensure the project’s risk 
documentation remains current and actionable. The process of updating the risk register is iterative 
and should be performed regularly throughout the project life cycle.

• 
Risk report. The risk report presents information on sources of overall project risk, together with 
summary information on identified individual project risks. The risk report is developed progressively 
throughout the risk processes. The risk report may include the results of the following processes as 
these processes are completed: 
Perform Risk Analysis, 
• 
Plan Risk Responses, 
• 
Implement Risk Responses, and 
• 
Monitor Risks. 
When the Identify Risks process is completed, information in the risk report may include but is not 
limited to the following: 
• 
Sources of overall project risk, indicating which are the most important drivers of overall 
project risk exposure; and 
• 
Summary information on identified individual project risks, such as number of identified 
threats and opportunities, distribution of risks across risk categories, metrics and trends, etc. 
Additional information may be included in the risk report, depending on the reporting requirements 
specified in the risk management plan. 
Schedule baseline. The schedule baseline is the approved version of a schedule model that can be 
changed using formal change control procedures and is used as the basis for comparison to actual 
results. The schedule baseline is accepted and approved by the appropriate stakeholders as the 
baseline for the schedule, with baseline start dates and baseline finish dates. During monitoring and 
controlling, the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and finish dates to determine 
if variances have occurred. The schedule baseline is a component of the project management plan. 
Schedule baseline updates. The schedule baseline updates refer to the modifications made to 
the project’s original schedule baseline, which is the approved timeline for the project’s tasks and 
milestones. These updates are necessary when significant changes occur that affect the project’s 
timing and should be formally integrated into the plan. 
Schedule data. The schedule data for the project schedule model is the collection of information 
for describing and controlling the schedule. The schedule data includes, at a minimum, the schedule 
milestones, schedule activities, activity attributes, and documentation of all identified assumptions 
and constraints. The amount of additional data varies by application area. Information frequently 
supplied as supporting detail includes but is not limited to the following: 
• 
Resource requirements by time period, often in the form of a resource histogram; 
• 
Alternative schedules, such as best case or worst case, not-resource-leveled or resource-
leveled, or with or without imposed dates; and 
• 
Applied schedule reserves. 
Schedule data may also include items such as resource histograms, cash flow projections, order and 
delivery schedules, or other relevant information. 
Schedule forecasts. Schedule forecasts are estimates or predictions of conditions and events in the 
project’s future based on information and knowledge available at the time the schedule is calculated.

Forecasts are updated and reissued based on work performance information provided as the project 
is executed. The information is based on the project’s past performance and its expected future 
performance based on corrective or preventive actions. This information may include earned value (EV) 
performance indicators as well as schedule reserve information that could impact the project in the future. 
Schedule management plan. The schedule management plan is a component of the program or 
project management plan that establishes the criteria and the activities for developing, monitoring, 
and controlling the schedule. The schedule management plan may be formal or informal and highly 
detailed or broadly framed based on the needs of the project. The plan also includes appropriate 
control thresholds. 
The schedule management plan can establish the following: 
• 
Project schedule model development. The scheduling methodology and the scheduling 
tool to be used in the development of the project schedule model are specified. 
• 
Release and iteration length. When using an adaptive life cycle, the timeboxed periods 
for releases, waves, and iterations are specified. Timeboxed periods are durations during 
which the team works steadily toward completion of a goal. Timeboxing helps to minimize 
scope creep as it forces the team to process essential features first, then other features 
when time permits. 
• 
Level of accuracy. The level of accuracy specifies the acceptable range used in determining 
realistic activity duration estimates and may include an amount for contingencies. 
• 
Units of measure. Each unit of measurement (e.g., staff hours, days, or weeks for time 
measures, or meters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures) is 
defined for each of the resources. 
• 
Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) provides the 
framework for the schedule management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates 
and resulting schedules. 
• 
Project schedule model maintenance. The process used to update the status and record 
progress of the project in the schedule model during the execution of the project is defined. 
• 
Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring schedule performance may be 
specified to indicate an agreed-upon amount of variation to be allowed before some action 
should be taken. Thresholds are typically expressed as percentage deviations from the 
parameters established in the baseline plan. 
• 
Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules or other 
physical measurement rules of performance measurement are set. For example, the 
schedule management plan may specify: 
◾ 
Rules for establishing percent complete, 
◾ 
Any EVM techniques (e.g., baselines, fixed formula, percent complete, etc.) to be 
employed (for more specific information, refer to The Standard for Earned Value 
Management [3]), and 
◾ 
Schedule performance measurements, such as schedule variance (SV) and schedule 
performance index (SPI), used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original 
schedule baseline. 
• 
Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various schedule reports are defined.

Scope baseline. The scope baseline is the approved version of formal scope documents that can 
be changed using formal change control procedures and is used as the basis for comparison to 
actual results. The scope baseline may include the approved version of a scope statement, work 
breakdown structure (WBS), and its associated WBS dictionary, and is a component of the project 
management plan. 
Components of the scope baseline include the following: 
• 
Project scope statement. The project scope statement includes the description of the 
project scope, major deliverables, and exclusions. 
• 
WBS. The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried 
out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required 
deliverables. Each descending level of the WBS represents an increasingly detailed 
definition of the project work: 
◾ 
Work package. The lowest level of the WBS is a work package with a unique identifier. 
These identifiers provide a structure for hierarchical summation of costs, schedule, 
and resource information and form a code of accounts. Each work package is part 
of a control account. A control account is a management control point where the 
scope, budget, and schedule are integrated and compared to the earned value for 
performance measurement. A control account has two or more work packages, though 
each work package is associated with a single control account. 
◾ 
Planning package. A control account may include one or more planning packages. 
A planning package is a WBS component below the control account and above the work 
package with known work content but without detailed schedule activities. 
• 
WBS dictionary. The WBS dictionary is a document that provides detailed deliverable, 
activity, scheduling, cost, and resource information about each component in the WBS. The 
WBS dictionary is a document that supports the WBS. Most information included in the 
WBS dictionary is created by other processes and added to this document at a later stage. 
Information in the WBS dictionary may include but is not limited to the following: 
◾ 
Code of account identifier, 
◾ 
Description of work, 
◾ 
Assumptions and constraints, 
◾ 
Responsible organization, 
◾ 
Schedule milestones, 
◾ 
Associated schedule activities, 
◾ 
Resources required, 
◾ 
Cost estimates, 
◾ 
Quality requirements, 
◾ 
Acceptance criteria, 
◾ 
Technical references, and 
◾ 
Agreement information.

Scope management plan. A scope management plan is a component of the program or project 
management plan that describes how the scope will be defined, developed, monitored, controlled, 
and validated. 
The components of a scope management plan include the following: 
• 
Process for preparing a project scope statement, 
• 
Process that enables the creation of the work breakdown structure (WBS) from the detailed 
project scope statement, 
• 
Process that establishes how the scope baseline will be approved and maintained, and 
• 
Process that specifies how formal acceptance of the completed project deliverables will be 
obtained. 
The scope management plan can be formal or informal and broadly framed or highly detailed, based 
on the needs of the project. 
Skill matrix. The skill matrix is a tool that maps out the skills and competencies required for a 
team or project and compares them against the skills available within the team. The matrix is used 
to identify any gaps in skills that should be addressed for the successful completion of a project. 
Creating and updating a skill matrix is an ongoing process that should be revisited regularly to ensure 
it reflects the current capabilities of the team and the needs of the project. 
Sourcing strategy plan. The sourcing strategy plan is a component of the project management plan 
that describes which elements of the project will be insourced, outsourced, or both. The sourcing 
strategy should contain the rationale for a given approach, based on the desired impact to project 
value, schedule, risk, finances, or other considerations. A sourcing strategy can be formal or informal, 
highly detailed or broadly framed, and is based upon the needs of each project. The sourcing strategy 
plan may or may not include the details of how outsourced procurement should be performed. The 
components of the sourcing strategy plan may include the following: 
• 
Insourcing or outsourcing decisions, and 
• 
Source selection criteria. 
Stakeholder engagement plan. The stakeholder engagement plan is a component of the program 
or project management plan that identifies the strategies and actions required to promote 
productive involvement of stakeholders in program or project decision-making and execution. 
The plan can be formal or informal and highly detailed or broadly framed, based on the needs of 
the project and the expectations of stakeholders. The stakeholder engagement plan may include 
but is not limited to specific strategies or approaches for engaging with individuals or groups of 
stakeholders. 
Stakeholder register. A stakeholder register is a project document that contains information 
about project stakeholders, including an assessment and classification of project stakeholders. This 
document contains information about the identified stakeholders that includes but is not limited to 
the following: 
• 
Identification information. Name, organizational position, location and contact details, 
and role on the project.

• 
Assessment information. Major requirements, expectations, potential for influencing 
project outcomes, and the phase of the project life cycle where the stakeholder has the 
most influence or impact. 
• 
Stakeholder classification. Internal/external, impact/influence/power/interest, upward/ 
downward/outward/sideward, or any other classification model chosen by the project 
manager. 
Status report. A status report is a document that provides information on the current status of the 
project. The report may include information on progress since the last report and forecasts for cost 
and schedule performance. 
Team charter. The team charter is a document that establishes the values, agreements, and 
operating guidelines for the team. The team charter may include but is not limited to the following: 
• 
Team values, 
• 
Communication guidelines, 
• 
Decision-making criteria and processes, 
• 
Conflict resolution processes, 
• 
Meeting guidelines, and 
• 
Team agreements. 
The team charter establishes clear expectations regarding acceptable behavior by project team 
members. Early commitment to clear guidelines decreases misunderstandings and increases 
productivity. Discussing areas such as codes of conduct, communication, decision-making, and 
meeting etiquette allows team members to discover values that are important to one another. The 
team charter works best when the team develops it or at least has an opportunity to contribute to it. 
All project team members share responsibility for ensuring the rules documented in the team charter 
are followed. The team charter can be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure a continued 
understanding of the team ground rules and to orient and integrate new team members. 
Team performance assessments. As project team development efforts such as training, team 
building, and colocation are implemented, the project management team makes formal or informal 
assessments of the project team’s effectiveness. Effective team development strategies and activities 
are expected to increase the team’s performance, which increases the likelihood of meeting project 
objectives. 
The evaluation of a team’s effectiveness may include indicators such as: 
• 
Improvements in skills that allow individuals to perform assignments more effectively, 
• 
Improvements in competencies that help team members perform better as a team, 
• 
Reduced staff turnover rate, and 
• 
Increased team cohesiveness where team members share information and experiences 
openly and help one another to improve the overall project performance. 
As a result of conducting an evaluation of the team’s overall performance, the project management 
team can identify the specific training, coaching, mentoring, assistance, or changes required

to improve the team’s performance. This effort should also include identifying the appropriate 
or required resources necessary to achieve and implement the improvements identified in the 
assessment. 
Team performance assignments. The team performance assignments refer to the allocation of tasks 
and responsibilities to team members based on their skills, roles, and the project’s requirements. The 
assignments are used to ensure that the project progresses efficiently and effectively. 
User stories. A user story is a brief, textual description of an outcome from a specific stakeholder 
perspective, and is a promise for a conversation to clarify details. User stories clarify details or 
required functionality in a conversational manner, which is a clear and concise representation of a 
requirement written from the end user’s perspective. A typical user story should describe the user or 
stakeholder’s role, who benefits from the feature (role), what the stakeholder needs to accomplish 
(goal), and the benefit to the stakeholder (motivation). The acceptance criteria in a user story should 
focus on the specific functionalities and end-user expectations that should be fulfilled. 
Verified deliverables. Verified deliverables are completed project deliverables that have been 
checked and confirmed for correctness through the Monitor and Control Scope process. A goal of 
the Monitor and Control Scope process is to determine the correctness of deliverables. The results 
of performing the Monitor and Control Scope process are verified deliverables that become an 
input to the Validate Scope process for formalized acceptance. If there are any change requests or 
improvements related to the deliverables, they should be changed, inspected, and reverified. 
Virtual resource assignments. Virtual resources include software, testing environments, licenses, 
and anything else created or seen using computers or the internet that is needed for efficient and 
effective project completion. Virtual resource assignments are the documentation of the virtual 
resources that will be used during the project. The virtual resource assignments describe the 
expected resource utilization and details such as type, amount, location, and whether the resource is 
internal to the organization or outsourced. 
WBS dictionary. See scope baseline. 
Work breakdown structure (WBS). See scope baseline. 
Work package estimation. The work package estimation is defined at the lowest level of the work 
breakdown structure (WBS), for which cost and duration are estimated and managed. For example, 
simulation can be used to estimate work packages. The simulation involves calculating multiple work 
package durations and costs with different sets of activity assumptions, constraints, risks, issues, or 
scenarios using probability distributions and other representations of uncertainty. Throughout the 
project, work packages are progressively elaborated into activities. 
Work performance data. Work performance data includes the raw observations and measurements 
identified during activities being performed to carry out project work. The data is often viewed as the 
lowest level of detail from which information is derived by other processes. The data is then gathered 
through work execution and passed to the controlling processes for further analysis. 
Examples of work performance data include work completed, key performance indicators (KPIs), 
technical performance measures, actual start and finish dates of schedule activities, story points 
completed, deliverables status, schedule progress, number of change requests, number of defects, 
actual costs incurred, actual durations, etc.

Work performance information. Work performance information includes the work performance 
data collected from controlling processes, analyzed in comparison with project management plan 
components, project documents, and other work performance details. This comparison helps to 
indicate how the project is performing. 
Specific work performance metrics for scope, schedule, budget, and quality are defined at the start 
of the project as part of the project management plan. Performance data is then collected during the 
project and compared to the plan and other variables to provide a context for work performance. 
For example, work performance data on cost may include funds that have been expended. 
However, to be useful, that data should be compared to the budget, the work that was performed, 
the resources used to accomplish the work, and the funding schedule. This additional information 
provides the context to determine if the project is on budget or if there is a variance. This information 
also indicates the degree of variance from the plan, and by comparing it to the variance thresholds in 
the project management plan it can indicate if preventive or corrective action is required. Interpreting 
work performance data and additional information provides a sound foundation for making project 
decisions. 
Work performance reports. Work performance reports are the physical or electronic 
representations of work performance information compiled in project documents, which are 
intended to generate decisions, actions, or awareness. The reports are circulated to project 
stakeholders through the communication processes as defined in the project’s communications 
management plan. 
Examples of work performance reports include status reports and progress reports. Work 
performance reports may contain status of configuration items, earned value (EV) graphs and 
information, trend lines and forecasts, iteration burndown charts, defect histograms, contract 
performance information, and risk summaries. The reports can be presented as dashboards, heat 
reports, stoplight charts, or other representations useful for promoting awareness and generating 
decisions and actions.
