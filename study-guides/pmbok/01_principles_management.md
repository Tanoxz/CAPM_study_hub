Introduction
The Standard for Project Management identifies project management principles that guide behaviours 
and actions of project professionals and other stakeholders who work on or are engaged with 
projects.
This introductory section describes the purpose of this standard, defines key terms and concepts, 
and id ntifies the audience for the standard.
The Standard for Project Management consists of the following sections:
▶ 	 Section 1 Introduction

Section 3 
Project Management Principles 
Principles for a profession serve as foundational guidelines for strategy, decision-making, and 
problem-solving. Professional standards and methodologies often derive from these principles. In 
some professions, principles act as prescriptive laws or rules. However, the principles of project 
management are not prescriptive, but rather are intended to reinforce the mindset and guide the 
behavior of people involved in projects. This standard is a “principle-based” standard. 
By adhering to these principles and aligning them with professional, organizational, and ethical 
values, project managers can navigate the complexities of their projects and drive meaningful, 
positive, and sustainable change within their organizations. These principles are broad, allowing for 
diverse ways through which individuals and organizations can maintain alignment with them, thereby 
fostering a dynamic and responsive project management environment. 
Because the project management principles provide guidance, their application and the manner 
in which they are applied are influenced by the context of the organization, project, deliverables, 
project team, stakeholders, and other factors. The principles are complementary and supplement 
one another, meaning that no principle contradicts another. However, in practice, there may be 
instances when the principles overlap, reflecting the complex and interconnected nature of project 
management.

This section defines the six principles of project management: 
• 
Adopt a Holistic View (see Section 3.3); 
• 
Focus on Value (see Section 3.4); 
• 
Embed Quality Into Processes and Deliverables (see Section 3.5); 
• 
Be an Accountable Leader (see Section 3.6); 
• 
Integrate Sustainability Within All Project Areas (see Section 3.7); and 
• 
Build an Empowered Culture (see Section 3.8). 
Collectively, these principles describe the mindset of project management, which in turn guides the 
mechanics of project management. This interplay between mindset and mechanics is discussed in 
Section 3.1. 
3.1 The Project Management Mindset 
Project management is much more than a collection of performance domains, processes, and 
methods; it represents a mindset, sometimes referred to as a “growth mindset,” that is fundamental 
for executing strategy, fostering adaptability, driving change, and generating value. A mindset is a set 
of beliefs, ways of thinking, and habits that make sense of the behaviors and views of others as well 
as a way to interpret and deal with various situations. The project management mindset is described 
by three dimensions and six principles that guide the practice of project management mechanics. 
The project management mindset is composed of three dimensions: proactive, ownership, and 
value-driven. This integrated mindset is essential in today’s complex and rapidly changing business 
environment that should balance diverse customer needs and consider the increasing need for—and 
importance of—sustainability. Figure 3-1 provides an overview of the relationships among these 
dimensions and the correlation with the project management principles described in this section.

Being proactive is a key habit that shapes effective project management and drives the team 
toward achieving strategic objectives. The proactive mindset in project management emphasizes 
systems thinking and appropriate levels of planning to help ensure that target quality thresholds 
are embedded within every phase of the project. The proactive mindset integrates the project 
management principles of Adopt a Holistic View and Embed Quality Into Processes and Deliverables, 
fostering a culture of continuous improvement and forward-thinking action (see Section 3.2 for 
details on the project management principles). The mindset enables project managers to anticipate 
challenges, address them promptly, and align processes with evolving project and stakeholder needs, 
thereby enhancing overall project resilience and success. 
The ownership dimension focuses on the accountability of leaders and the development of a high-
performance team culture. This dimension integrates the principles of Be an Accountable Leader and 
Build an Empowered Culture, ensuring that leadership is not just about making decisions but also 
about fostering a culture of accountability and collaboration. This mindset supports the development 
of strong, self-reliant teams that drive project success through shared ownership and commitment. 
The value-driven dimension emphasizes delivering maximum value by seamlessly integrating 
sustainability throughout the project life cycle. This dimension incorporates the principles of Focus 
on Value and Integrate Sustainability Within All Project Areas. By aligning projects with organizational 
strategic objectives and emphasizing contributions to the broader community and the environment 
(i.e., achieving the triple bottom line of people, profit, and planet), this dimension helps ensure that 
project outcomes are both impactful and sustainable. Ultimately, the value-driven dimension promotes 
a balance between achieving measurable success and advancing broader sustainability goals. 
By integrating the proactive, ownership, and value-driven mindset dimensions, organizations can 
create a solid framework for achieving exceptional project results. This holistic approach helps ensure 
that projects are planned and executed in a manner intended to meet or exceed target business 
objectives (proactive), lead with accountability and empowerment (ownership), and drive projects 
forward with a focus on value and sustainability (value-driven). Together, these dimensions enable 
organizations to deliver projects that not only drive the execution of an organization’s strategy, but 
are also socially responsible and environmentally sustainable. 
3.2 Principles and Performance Domains 
Performance domains are designed to enable the practical application of project management 
principles and ensure this mindset is translated into effective practices and outcomes. These 
performance domains represent the mechanics of project management, including the knowledge, 
processes, and methods that are essential for effective project delivery. 
The project management performance domains include Governance, Scope (including quality), 
Schedule, Finance, Stakeholders, Resources, and Risk. These performance domains are described in 
detail in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) [2]. 
Each performance domain plays an important role in operationalizing project management principles 
by providing a structured approach to managing various aspects of a project. Conversely, the project 
management principles serve as the foundation of the performance domains. 
While all the principles relate to all performance domains, some are connected more strongly than 
others. For instance, the Adopt a Holistic View principle is supported by all performance domains, which

The Standard for Project Management
 
helps ensure that all project aspects are considered and aligned. The Embed Quality Into Processes 
and Deliverables and Focus on Value principles are primarily addressed within the Governance, Scope, 
Risk, Schedule, Finance, and Stakeholders performance domains, ensuring the deliverables genuinely 
help drive realization of the project’s target business objectives. The Be an Accountable Leader principle 
intersects with the Governance, Stakeholders, and Risk performance domains, highlighting the 
importance of leadership in project success. Finally, the Integrate Sustainability Within All Project Areas 
and Build an Empowered Culture principles are relevant across all performance domains. 
3.3 Adopt a Holistic View 
The Adopt a Holistic View principle involves understanding and managing projects by considering all 
components and their interdependencies as part of a larger system (see Figure 3-2). This perspective 
aligns with the concept of systems thinking, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of elements 
within a project. This principle provides a framework for viewing interrelationships in their full 
context and for seeing patterns rather than static “snapshots.” 
Embracing a holistic perspective is crucial for managing project complexity, as it enables project 
managers to grasp the overall situation and the connections among different project components. This 
method aids in pinpointing the root causes of challenges and tackling them efficiently. Additionally, 
aligning with systems thinking, a holistic perspective fosters an in-depth comprehension of the project 
landscape. Viewing the project as a unified entity makes it simpler to trace problems to their origins, 
allowing for an interdisciplinary approach that fosters more innovative and effective solutions. 
3.3.1 Project Impact 
Applying a holistic view to project management results in a more integrated and cohesive approach 
to achieving project goals. Key characteristics of projects managed with a holistic view include: 
• 
Alignment with organizational strategy and goals. Projects are more likely to contribute 
positively to the strategic objectives of the organization. 
Adopt a Holistic View 
Adopt a holistic view 
throughout the project life 
cycle‚ from initiation all 
the way to execution and 
closing‚ ensuring seamless 
integration and alignment 
at every stage. 
Viewing a project holistically helps ensure that decisions 
consider all interconnected elements, optimizing alignment 
with overarching objectives and enhancing project 
sustainability. 
Proactively managing risks across all project domains 
anticipates challenges and strengthens project resilience, 
minimizing potential disruptions. 
Engaging stakeholders throughout the project life cycle 
fosters collaboration, integrates diverse perspectives, and 
raises the probability that desired outcomes are achieved.

• 
Integrated decision-making. Decisions are made considering the disparate perspectives 
across the entire project ecosystem, ensuring that outputs lead to more sustainable and 
effective outcomes. 
• 
Enhanced communication. Clear and consistent communication across all stakeholders 
helps ensure that everyone is informed and aligned. 
• 
Managing uncertainty and complexity. In projects with high uncertainty, a holistic view 
helps ensure that planning and execution incorporate techniques to progressively identify 
and address sources of uncertainty and possible impacts that are likely to harm the 
project’s value proposition. Similarly, for highly complex projects, a holistic approach seeks 
to understand and simplify the intricate interdependencies within the project, uncovering 
inherent simplicity. 
• 
Proactive and pragmatic risk management. By having a holistic view from the onset, 
the project management team can have a wider and clearer understanding of the 
interconnectedness of the project. Hence, the project management team is in a better 
position for informed and timely decision-making to effectively and efficiently mitigate 
threats while exploiting opportunities. 
Having a holistic approach to sustainability can ensure that all aspects of the project are making a 
positive contribution (or at least any negative contribution is quantified). This approach can relate 
to the environmental cost/impact of the project activities as well as the environmental benefits (or 
negative impacts) delivered by the project. This approach also aligns with the Integrate Sustainability 
Within All Project Areas principle. By embracing a holistic view, project managers and stakeholders 
can increase the likelihood of considering all aspects of the project, leading to better decision-making 
and more effective project execution, which not only aligns with organizational goals but also fosters 
resilience and adaptability, resulting in a successful project. 
3.3.2 Principle in Action 
To provide an example of this principle in action, consider a nonprofit, nongovernmental organization 
(NGO) that is launching a project to promote public health practices in a local community, supported 
by a dedicated volunteer team. Following a conventional, narrowly focused approach, the focus is on 
creating educational materials and then organizing events. However, midway through the project, 
the NGO learns of a local government initiative with similar goals, offering a funding grant for aligned 
efforts. Recognizing the potential for greater impact, the team adapts their communications to align 
with the government initiative, qualifying for the grant. While this introduces stricter policy and 
communication constraints, the project now has more resources and broader reach, enabling the 
NGO to make a more significant and lasting impact on public health in the community. 
3.3.3 Connected Performance Domains 
The Adopt a Holistic View principle interacts with and elevates the performance of all domains. By 
applying this principle, each domain can be managed more effectively, helping to ensure a cohesive 
and integrated approach to project management. This principle benefits each project management 
performance domain in the following ways: 
• 
Governance. A holistic view promotes transparency and accountability, enabling informed, 
data-driven decision-making based on a wider scope and impacts that can drive progress in 
a manner that maximizes the positive impact from project investments for a given portfolio, 
program, or project.

The Standard for Project Management
• 
Scope. The principle of Adopt a Holistic View helps foster alignment of all project activities 
with the overall project scope, preventing scope creep and misalignment by considering 
the entire project ecosystem. Also, by promoting clarity on the organizational objectives 
to be achieved rather than merely the end deliverables, the principle encourages 
creative solutioning, allowing an equal opportunity to achieve simpler but more effective, 
sustainable, and long-lasting solutions. 
• 
Schedule. A holistic view improves scheduling by considering the interdependencies of all 
project activities, making timelines more realistic and adaptive to changes and maintaining 
alignment with project goals. By implementing a holistic view, the project management team 
can ensure that the most relevant what-if scenarios are drawn out and evaluated, and that 
candidate baseline changes are evaluated for which one might yield the highest return on 
investment for that project—and for the project’s portfolio and program contexts overall. 
• 
Finance. A holistic approach optimizes financial management by aligning budget allocations 
with project priorities, controlling project costs effectively, and anticipating financial impacts 
of changes within the broader project context—all aimed at maximizing returns on project 
investments. 
• 
Stakeholders. The Adopt a Holistic View principle enhances the engagement of all relevant 
stakeholders, from departments to vendors to customers. This engagement is done 
by ensuring inclusive participation in decision-making processes, leading to improved 
satisfaction and collaboration as their perspectives are integrated into the project strategy. 
• 
Resources. Having a holistic mindset also emphasizes understanding how all project 
components are intended to integrate in order to maximize the project’s value proposition. 
This view makes it easier to drive the flow of completed work, avoid unnecessary resource 
conflicts, optimize the use of project resources within a portfolio or program, and equip and 
empower team members to execute the work, all according to what drives the most value. 
• 
Risk. A holistic view facilitates proactive risk management by identifying and managing risks 
across all project domains, understanding their interdependencies, and developing robust 
risk management strategies. 
3.4 Focus on Value 
Value, also referred to as project value, is the ultimate success indicator and driver of projects. Value 
can be described and assessed using either measurable metrics, such as return on investment, or 
qualitative observations such as testimonials and societal benefits. Value represents the overall 
worth of the project outcomes and the net benefits to stakeholders (see Figure 3-3). This value 
encompasses the deliverables and their related outcomes, particularly from the perspective of 
key stakeholders. Value can be expressed in various ways, such as financial contributions to the 
sponsoring or receiving organization, social benefits, or the customer’s perceived benefits from the 
project result. Regardless of their form, all projects exist to pursue target organizational objectives 
that are worth more than what is invested in pursuit of those objectives—often significantly more 
than what might be available via alternative investment options. 
Project justification and organizational strategy, often detailed in a business case, provide the project 
team with the necessary information to make decisions that meet or exceed the intended business 
value. Desired outcomes should be clearly described, iteratively assessed, and updated throughout 
the project life cycle using quality gates, feedback loops, and regular reviews. The project team 
should adapt to changes and continuously evaluate alignment with the desired outputs, baselines,

Focus on Value 
Continually evaluate and 
adjust project alignment 
to business objectives and 
intended benefts and 
value. 
Value per unit of investment is the ultimate indicator of 
project success. 
Value can be realized throughout the project, at the end of 
the project, or following project completion.˜˜ 
Value, and the benefts that contribute to it, can be defned 
in quantitative and/or qualitative terms. 
Project teams focus on outcomes that maximize value 
creation and meet or exceed target business objectives. 
Project teams evaluate progress and adapt to maximize the 
expected value. 
Figure 3-3. Focus on Value 
business case, and intended outcomes. If misalignment persists or the project is unlikely to deliver 
the intended value, it may be best to terminate the effort. 
A focus on value aims to maximize the return on project investments for the customer, performing 
organization, and/or other stakeholders. This effort involves delivering the required functionality and 
quality by optimizing workflows with acceptable risk exposure, using minimal necessary resources, 
and avoiding unnecessary rework and other types of waste. In adaptive projects without a fixed 
scope, the project team collaborates with the customer to determine which features are worth the 
investment in both time and money. 
The value contribution of project work can be short term or long term and may be intertwined with 
operational activities, making it challenging to isolate. When a project is part of a program, evaluating 
value at the program level is necessary to properly direct the project. The project value provides key data 
for portfolio management so that decisions can be made on which projects to select or continue based 
on their value contribution. A reliable evaluation of value should consider the entire context and life cycle 
of the project as well as its expected payback period, which may extend well beyond project closeout. 
3.4.1 Project Impact 
Shifting focus from deliverables to intended outcomes allows project teams to deliver on the project’s 
vision or purpose, rather than merely creating a specific deliverable. While a deliverable may support 
the intended project outcome, it may not fully achieve the project’s vision or purpose. For example, 
customers may want specific software because they believe it will resolve their business need for 
higher productivity. The software is the output of the project, but it does not enable productivity by 
itself. Adding a new deliverable, such as training in the use of the software, can enable a higher-value 
outcome. If the project’s output fails to enable the desired productivity, then the value proposition of 
the project is undermined and may even become more harmful than helpful, given the investment in 
time and resources. Therefore, project teams, stakeholders, and in particular, team members, should 
understand both the deliverable and the intended outcome from the deliverable.

The Standard for Project Management
3.4.2 Principle in Action 
To provide an example of the Focus on Value principle in action, consider a company that is 
undertaking a project to roll out a new internal technology system. A conventional approach might 
focus on choosing a product with the most features for the price and then customizing it to meet all 
of the requested stakeholder requirements. In contrast, a value-focused approach aligns the project 
with business outcomes like maximizing usage and adoption. A deeper look might reveal a fast-paced 
organizational culture that values simplicity of experience over complexity of features. By reducing 
features and customizations, the more simplified solution might better match the culture, and thus 
increase overall usage and satisfaction. 
3.4.3 Connected Performance Domains 
The Focus on Value principle interacts with and elevates the practice of all project management 
performance domains. By applying this principle, each domain can be managed more effectively, 
ensuring that the project maximizes value for the stakeholders. The relevant connections 
between this principle and specific project management performance domains include the 
following: 
• 
Governance. A value-focused approach establishes frameworks and processes that help 
ensure decisions are made in alignment with the project’s value objectives. Governance is 
“right-sized” to focus on value delivery, not bureaucracy. 
• 
Scope. A value-focused approach can help to define and control the project scope to 
ensure that all work contributes to the intended value. This approach involves continuous 
scope management to prevent scope creep and gold plating and to ensure that the project 
remains focused on delivering its key outcomes. 
• 
Schedule. A focus on value helps to ensure that time is managed effectively to help the 
project to deliver the expected value by—or earlier than—the target date. This effort 
includes planning and controlling the project schedule to avoid delays that could diminish 
the project’s value. 
• 
Finance. The Focus on Value principle helps ensure that financial resources are allocated 
efficiently to maximize the project’s value. This effort involves continuous assessment of 
financial performance against the business case to ensure that the project remains viable 
and delivers the expected financial benefits. 
• 
Stakeholders. A value mindset can help when engaging with stakeholders to understand 
their needs and expectations, ensuring that the project delivers value from their 
perspective. Effective stakeholder engagement helps align the project’s outputs with the 
desired outcomes and enhances stakeholder satisfaction. 
• 
Resources. Keeping a project’s value proposition at the center of attention can help 
inform decisions around physical assets and project team talent. For example, financial 
constraints may not allow the hiring of specialized team members needed to achieve 
project goals. In that case, focusing on value can spark alternative solutions such as 
cross-training existing team members. 
• 
Risk. Focusing on value helps ensure that the approach taken to address uncertainty in the 
project, whether responding to known or emergent threats or responding to opportunities, 
is pragmatic in the sense of effectiveness, efficiency, and transparency.

3.5 Embed Quality Into Processes and Deliverables 
Quality is the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics of a project deliverable or process 
helps to meet or exceed the project’s target objectives. Embedding quality includes the ability to 
satisfy customers and stakeholders’ stated or implied needs as a matter of course, at or above 
target levels of efficiency (see Figure 3-4). The quality of the deliverable and the processes used to 
achieve it are measured by conformance to acceptance criteria, the definition of done (DoD), fitness 
for use, and overall efficiency. While quality thresholds typically address scope specifications, they 
can also apply to schedule and cost, especially for projects where the value proposition may be 
highly sensitive to those factors. Adopting a continuous improvement mindset optimizes processes, 
boosts efficiency, and enhances maturity growth for the whole organization, leading to better project 
outcomes and overall organizational success for present and future endeavors. 
Foundational to embedding target quality thresholds is continuous improvement and waste 
elimination. These practices enable project teams to refine their processes, optimize resource 
utilization, and deliver outcomes that meet or exceed target objectives. Continuous improvement 
allows teams to proactively identify and address areas for enhancement in both deliverables and 
workflows, while waste elimination streamlines processes, conserving resources and improving 
performance. Quality spans several dimensions that apply to both deliverables and processes, 
including but not limited to the following: 
• 
Performance. Do the deliverables or processes function as intended by the project team 
and other stakeholders? 
• 
Conformity. Are the deliverables and processes aligned with specifications and fit for use? 
• 
Reliability. Do the deliverables and processes maintain the consistency necessary to meet 
or exceed desired outcomes? 
Embed Quality Into Processes and Deliverables 
Embed quality into 
processes and deliverables 
to maintain a consistent 
focus on achieving target 
quality thresholds. This 
emphasis on quality helps 
to ensure outcomes that 
meet project objectives 
and align with the needs, 
requirements, and 
acceptance criteria set by 
relevant stakeholders.˜ 
Project quality entails satisfying relevant stakeholders’ 
expectations and fulflling project and product requirements. 
Quality focuses on meeting acceptance criteria for deliverables. 
Project quality entails ensuring project processes are 
appropriate and as effective as possible.

The Standard for Project Management
 
• 
Resilience. Can the deliverables and supporting processes cope with unforeseen failures 
and recover quickly? 
• 
Satisfaction. Do the deliverables and processes elicit valuable feedback from customers 
and/or end users, including usability and user experience? 
• 
Uniformity. Do the deliverables and processes demonstrate parity across similar outputs or 
workflows? 
• 
Efficiency. Are the deliverables and processes optimized to produce the greatest output 
with the least input? 
• 
Sustainability. Do the deliverables and processes contribute positively to economic, social, 
and environmental outcomes? 
• 
Compliance. Do the deliverables and processes comply with regulatory requirements and 
relevant industry standards, as well as organizational standards? 
Project teams measure quality using metrics and acceptance criteria based on project specifications. 
A specification is an attribute that is necessary to be present in a project deliverable to help meet 
or exceed a target objective. Quality is linked to the product acceptance criteria, as described in the 
project charter, statement of work (SOW), or other key documents. In some projects, as the project 
evolves through experimentation, these criteria should be regularly updated and refined. Ensuring 
these criteria are validated during the acceptance process is essential to meeting project objectives 
and delivering a successful product. 
Quality is also relevant to the project approaches and activities used to produce the project’s 
deliverables. Project teams can pursue the target quality thresholds of both the project and the 
product by providing training, conducting inspections, and performing testing. Additionally, project 
activities and processes are evaluated through reviews and audits. Both approaches aim to identify 
and prevent errors and defects, thereby maintaining an accelerated flow of completed work while 
pursuing target quality thresholds. 
3.5.1 Project Impact 
The objective of quality activities is to help ensure that what is delivered meets the objectives of the 
customer and other relevant stakeholders. The intention is to minimize the waste of resources and 
maximize the probability of attaining the desired outcome. This effort results in the following: 
• 
Moving the deliverables to the point of delivery without unnecessary delays, and 
• 
Minimizing the need for rework and/or reducing material waste through the early detection 
and prevention of defects. 
The objective of quality activities is the same whether dealing with an up-front, well-defined set of 
requirements or a set of requirements that is progressively elaborated and incrementally delivered. 
Quality management processes and practices help produce deliverables and outcomes that meet 
project objectives and align to the expectations, requirements, and acceptance criteria expressed 
by the organization and relevant stakeholders. Close attention to quality in project processes and 
deliverables creates positive outcomes, including the following: 
• 
Project deliverables that are fit for purpose and that meet acceptance criteria, stakeholder 
expectations, and organizational objectives;

• 
Timely delivery, enhanced cost control, and attainment of the level of product quality 
associated with meeting or exceeding target objectives; 
• 
Reduced rework, scrap, customer complaints, and other types of waste; 
• 
Effective supply chain integration, increased productivity, and robust service delivery; 
• 
Higher project team morale and satisfaction; 
• 
Reduced negative impact on the environment, including avoiding the unnecessary 
consumption of natural resources and emissions due to rework activities, as well as the 
overhead of managing activities that may require travel; and 
• 
Better decision-making and continuous process improvement. 
3.5.2 Principle in Action 
To provide an example of the Embed Quality Into Processes and Deliverables principle in action, 
consider a company that is expanding its wholesale shipping services to support an unfamiliar 
regional market. A conventional approach would focus on meeting the governmental shipping 
specifications for each target market and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. 
In contrast, a quality-driven approach would investigate the expectations of the broader stakeholder 
system, including target distributors and retailers. This deeper analysis might reveal that high-value 
customers have stricter standards than regulatory bodies, which could influence packaging, delivery 
times, or product handling. By addressing these higher standards, the company not only meets legal 
requirements but also exceeds customer expectations, leading to stronger market entry, enhanced 
customer satisfaction, and potentially greater market share. 
3.5.3 Connected Performance Domains 
The Embed Quality Into Processes and Deliverables principle is critical in all project management 
performance domains because it is essential to ensuring that project outcomes meet stakeholder 
needs and expectations. This principle should be embedded in the project’s design across people, 
processes, and structure. Different industries, companies, and contexts have different approaches 
to quality, but commitment to achieving the right level of quality is entrenched in the successful 
outcomes of all projects, across domain areas. A lack of commitment to the right level of quality in 
any domain can lead to erosion of the end result and poor project outcomes. This quality-focused 
principle affects the performance domains in the following ways: 
• 
Governance. Embedding quality into governance processes improves transparency and 
accountability. Governance structures help ensure that quality standards are met and can 
enable decisions that prioritize quality in all project activities. 
• 
Scope. The connection between quality and the Scope performance domain is particularly 
strong, as scope management inherently involves quality management activities. Ensuring 
that project deliverables meet the requirements, necessary standards, and specifications is 
an important aspect of scope management. By embedding the right level of quality into the 
scope, the project team can ensure that all deliverables are not only completed within the 
defined boundaries, but also meet quality standards, which prevents rework and ensures 
stakeholder satisfaction.

• 
Schedule. An emphasis on quality has implications for the project’s schedule. Examples 
include ensuring scheduling practices and artifacts are reviewed for completeness and 
correctness; integrating product quality reviews as scheduled milestones; and practicing a 
“shift-left” approach, where quality practices are prioritized as early in the project life cycle 
as possible. 
• 
Finance. Embedding quality into finance helps control costs by preventing rework and 
reducing waste. Aligning financial management with quality objectives supports cost control 
while pursuing the project’s objectives. 
• 
Stakeholders. Quality in this performance domain helps ensure that stakeholder expectations 
are met. Through continuous communication, stakeholder feedback is integrated into the 
project aspects, leading to increased satisfaction, collaboration, and credibility. 
• 
Resources. In this performance domain, embedding quality can ensure that the right 
resources are allocated to maintain target quality thresholds. This effort includes using 
skilled personnel and appropriate tools, helping to ensure that the project is adequately 
supported to deliver the intended results. 
• 
Risk. The Risk performance domain encompasses the proactive management of quality-
related risks. By embedding quality into every aspect of the project, potential quality issues 
can be anticipated and mitigated, reducing the risk of defects and noncompliance. 
3.6 Be an Accountable Leader 
Projects create a unique need for effective leadership. Unlike general business operations, where roles 
and responsibilities are often established and consistent, projects may involve multiple organizations, 
departments, functions, or vendors that do not interact on a regular basis. Moreover, projects may 
carry higher stakes and expectations than regular operational functions. As a result, a broader array 
of managers, executives, senior contributors, and other stakeholders may attempt to influence a 
project. This diversity of influence often creates higher degrees of confusion and conflict. Consequently, 
effective leadership behaviors are found more frequently—and from more people—on high-performing 
projects than lower-performing projects. Accountable leadership is about being responsible and taking 
ownership of the project’s target business objectives, as well as the actions taken and the decisions 
made (see Figure 3-5). When accepting or pulling work, accountability means being responsible for the 
execution of that work. The key characteristics of an accountable leader include the following: 
• 
Integrity, honesty, and fairness. These values are required of all team members, where 
people demonstrate the moral principles that guide their decisions, particularly in tough 
situations. The decisions made by a leader with integrity and fairness are focused on the 
common good, helping to build trust with stakeholders. 
• 
Self-awareness. Effective leaders have the capability to make connections among their 
feelings, thoughts, and actions by understanding their motives, values, and strengths. 
This self-awareness helps professionals build relationships to accomplish results. 
• 
Respectfulness, humility, and availability. Leaders should be open to feedback and 
should work for the team, supporting their needs and removing barriers when possible. 
These values form the basis for the concept of servant leadership. 
• 
Flexibility and adaptability. Leaders should have the capability to adapt their leadership 
style to the situation and the audience. Leadership styles should be adapted based on the 
project’s needs without losing the leader’s core values.

Leaders are accountable for their actions. 
Effective leaders lead by example. 
Leaders demonstrate responsibility, respect, fairness, and honesty. 
Effective leaders adapt their style to the situation. 
Leaders foster an environment of psychological safety. 
Any project professional, stakeholder, and team member can 
demonstrate leadership behaviors. 
Figure 3-5. Be an Accountable Leader 
• 
Shared leadership. Leadership is not exclusive to any specific role; in different moments 
of the project, a team member, stakeholder, or professional may take the leadership seat. 
High-performing projects feature multiple people exercising leadership skills. Leadership is 
different from authority. Authority is the position of control given to individuals within the 
organization, whereas leadership is about inspiring and motivating others through leading 
by example. 
3.6.1 Project Impact 
As leaders, project managers influence—through their behavior—all of the professionals involved 
in a project. A project manager influences the project and team through a combination of 
leadership, effective communication, decision-making, emotional intelligence, problem-solving, 
stakeholder engagement, and strategic thinking. Their leadership style directly shapes team 
dynamics, motivation, and overall performance. Emotional intelligence enables the project 
manager to navigate conflicts and stress while strong stakeholder engagement helps secure 
support and buy-in. 
Accountable leaders focus on delivering value beyond the project work. They commit to promoting 
the growth of other leaders around them and making a positive impact on their area of influence. 
The implications of this principle are profound and diverse for the project manager and all relevant 
stakeholders and lead to the following: 
• 
Enhanced team performance, 
• 
Increased trust and morale, 
• 
Improved decision-making, 
• 
Greater stakeholder confidence, and 
• 
Resilience in facing challenges.

The Standard for Project Management
3.6.2 Principle in Action 
To provide an example of the Be an Accountable Leader principle, consider a government 
megaproject that involves multiple vendors. In the project, a conflict arises among the vendor teams 
over previously arranged shift rotations. A conventional approach would focus on enforcing the 
contractually agreed-upon labor policies and holding each vendor accountable for resolving the 
discontent among their staff. 
In contrast, applying this principle could involve holding a series of cross-vendor discussions to 
explore the root cause of the issue and identify acceptable adjustments to the shift rotations. This 
collaborative approach not only resolves the conflict but also removes friction that could undermine 
quality and productivity, fostering a more cohesive and motivated project team. 
3.6.3 Connected Performance Domains 
The principle of Be an Accountable Leader supports many project management performance 
domains and can enhance the effectiveness of the project manager when well applied, such as with 
the following: 
• 
Governance. In the Governance performance domain, accountable leadership can ensure 
that decisions are made transparently and ethically. Leaders take ownership of the project’s 
direction and outcomes, fostering trust and ensuring that governance structures are upheld. 
• 
Scope. Every project faces difficult decisions around what scope to include or exclude. 
Strong leadership should confront and resolve scope disagreements in a way that unites 
stakeholders on the project’s value proposition. 
• 
Schedule. Reliable project schedules are the result of collaborative discussions among the 
project team, senior management, and other stakeholders. Accountable leadership should 
ensure that those discussions include the appropriate parties and that there is alignment 
on schedule activities and artifacts. 
• 
Finance. Every project involves financial considerations. Accountable leadership neither 
ignores nor carelessly addresses such considerations. Instead, this principle encourages 
practitioners to manage pressures that come when costs are scrutinized, reserves are 
applied, or other financial challenges arise. 
• 
Stakeholders. An effective leader is able to engage and influence stakeholders and 
sponsors to secure and maintain the support that is needed for the project. 
• 
Resources. Self-awareness helps to build relationships and foster human interactions to 
obtain better results. An effective leader manages resources with responsibility and integrity. 
• 
Risk. An effective leader can adapt and be flexible to opportunities or threats that a project 
team may face. Effective leaders demonstrate integrity and accountability to help ensure that 
risk is managed in a way that protects and enhances the project’s overall value proposition. 
3.7 Integrate Sustainability Within All Project Areas 
The principle of Integrate Sustainability Within All Project Areas involves meeting present needs 
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs (see Figure 3-6). This 
principle may involve adopting technology responsibly to foster a better future, while systematically 
identifying and mitigating any adverse impacts on the organization, community, and environment.

Consistently integrate 
sustainability practices 
across all project areas, 
through all phases of the 
project life cycle, as 
project managers, teams, 
and sponsors are all 
jointly accountable for 
ensuring this integration.˜ 
Integrating sustainability means considering people, the 
planet, society, and value while performing project-related 
activities. 
Sustainability encompasses addressing environmental, social, 
and economic impacts, considering the well-being of people 
globally, the effective and wise use of natural resources, 
and implementing sustainable strategies. 
The sustainability principle can be evident at the tactical, 
operational, and strategic levels of all projects. 
Figure 3-6. Integrate Sustainability Within All Project Areas 
This principle involves considering strategies to address any externality that the project may 
create. Such strategies can be categorized as increasingly impactful, from at least compensating 
stakeholders for the negative outcomes created, to minimizing them, to avoiding them altogether 
(see Figure 3-7). This approach addresses environmental impacts, considerations for the well-being of 
people globally, and the implementation of sustainable strategies.

Sustainability is essential for addressing global challenges such as climate change, biodiversity 
loss, pollution, societal inequities, and community well-being. By integrating sustainability into 
project management, organizations can align with the triple bottom line‚ balancing social equity, 
environmental stewardship, and economic prosperity. This dual focus on sustainability and 
project outcomes not only enhances corporate social responsibility but also fosters innovative and 
responsible technological practices that contribute to long-term value creation. Other benefits for 
organizations implementing sustainability broadly include the following: 
• 
Organizational benefits. These benefits include employee satisfaction, performance 
improvements, staff retention, and stronger recruitment. Additional benefits include 
improved relationships with shareholders and stakeholders, optimized risk responses and 
impacts, increased resilience and organizational learning, and enhanced decision-making 
processes. This overall improvement results from resolving ethical dilemmas, enhancing 
corporate governance, complying with laws and regulations, reducing litigation costs, 
increasing brand value, and boosting corporate reputation. 
• 
Operational benefits. These benefits include innovation in internal processes, productivity 
improvements due to operational waste minimization, and designing for sustainability. 
• 
Financial benefits. These benefits include but are not limited to direct cost savings from 
reduced material and energy usage, lower operational costs, less waste, decreased capital 
expenses, increased share value, and more investments from sustainable finance investors. 
• 
Benefits related to customers and stakeholders. These benefits include increased 
satisfaction and innovation driven by active listening and open communication with 
customers and stakeholders throughout the project life cycle. Additional advantages are 
market share growth due to the rising demand for sustainable and innovative products 
globally, a stronger reputation, and new market opportunities. 
3.7.1 Project Impact 
Sustainability principles can be evident at all tactical, operational, and strategic levels of projects. 
Indeed, relevant processes and practices may already be integrated into enterprise environmental 
factors (EEFs). For example, enterprise sustainability or information management strategies may 
impose requirements on project deliverables and teams. Additionally, these principles can impact 
projects from initiation to closure. For instance, sustainability-related key performance indicators 
(KPIs) may be included in the project scope statement, project charter, business case, contracts, 
or other formal documents authorizing project activities. Compliance can be monitored during 
project planning, execution, and closure. As sustainability is integrated into strategic goals for 
most organizations and communities, projects play a pivotal role in realizing sustainable practices 
and outcomes (see Figure 3-8). Instilling sustainability in project management requires the 
following: 
• 
Having a societal perspective for projects and their outcomes; 
• 
Maintaining broad stakeholder engagement through a “management for stakeholder” 
approach; 
• 
Leading the team and stakeholders with responsible (ethical) leadership; and 
• 
Holistically focusing on the value generated by the project from the perspective of the 
broader stakeholder audience such as value creation and distribution.

Figure 3-8. Sustainability Broadens the Orientation of Project Management 
The inclusion of sustainability goals does generate some challenges, such as the following: 
• 
Integrating sustainability broadens the scope of project management by considering
broader time orientations and more stakeholders. This in turn may increase the costs or
complexities of managing projects. Sustainability goals should be included in the formal
project documents, such as the business case, and confirmed by the project sponsor. If
these goals are not included, the project manager should still encourage discussions about
their impact during meetings and among stakeholders.
• 
Sustainability risks arise when project activities fail to balance or integrate societal,
economic, and environmental considerations, potentially jeopardizing the overall
sustainability of the project. Examples include prioritizing cost over environmental
stewardship, failing to account for community impacts, or underestimating regulatory
compliance requirements tied to sustainability. Such risks can lead to negative project
outcomes, stakeholder dissatisfaction, and long-term harm to the organization’s reputation
or performance.
• 
Assessing a project’s success is challenging due to the lack of universal sustainability
criteria; each project requires a tailored approach. To promote sustainability and reduce
waste, the project team should have access to tools that provide the necessary information
for them to fully manage the sustainability of their work.

3.7.2 Principle in Action 
To provide an example of the principle of Integrate Sustainability Within All Project Areas, consider a 
construction project. Construction projects often require materials derived from natural resources, 
which may be sourced externally. If sustainability principles are overlooked, the project team might 
choose the least expensive materials, potentially harming the environment and human health. By 
adhering to sustainability principles, the project team not only focuses on the project’s value and the 
internal rate of return, but also demonstrates a commitment to environmental sustainability and the 
responsible use of materials and natural resources while involving local communities. This effort could 
involve carefully planning the required materials and selecting sources with the least environmental 
impact or seeking materials that mimic natural processes and draw inspiration from nature 
(e.g., constructing urban buildings with wood or using recycled concrete instead of natural stone). 
Technology projects can enhance sustainability by integrating eco-friendly practices into project 
management, emphasizing social responsibility, and maximizing social impact. By adopting 
appropriate tools and innovative technologies, project teams can reduce resource consumption and 
waste, streamline processes, and improve efficiency. Projects can also focus on creating positive social 
impacts such as improving access to education and healthcare through technology. Environmental 
sustainability is achieved by selecting sustainable materials, minimizing carbon footprints, and 
implementing eco-friendly technologies. This holistic approach helps foster a more sustainable future. 
3.7.3 Connected Performance Domains 
The Integrate Sustainability Within All Project Areas principle may impact the Finance performance 
domain as sustainable practices may require additional funding, but they may also reduce the level of 
financial threat for the project (and the funding organization). The project team may consider green 
benefits to be included in the project requirements. 
The principle of Integrate Sustainability Within All Project Areas can positively impact the Risk 
performance domain by enabling proactive identification and mitigation of long-term risks, such 
as environmental, regulatory, or societal challenges. Sustainability initiatives can also create 
opportunities for innovation by encouraging project teams to develop resource-efficient solutions 
and sustainable practices. Embedding societal and environmental values into project management 
strengthens the Governance, Scope, and Stakeholders performance domains by fostering 
accountability, aligning scope with organizational goals and societal needs, and enhancing stakeholder 
trust. This approach benefits the project team during execution and delivers lasting value to the 
organization, improving its reputation and resilience once the project or product life cycle is complete. 
Integrating sustainability can affect many aspects of a project, including but not limited to the following: 
• 
Governance. The project team’s proactive and collaborative approach with the governance 
team develops a positive, transparent communication channel with management, helping 
to ensure alignment with the project objectives and outcomes, with the least deviations 
and less confusion. This approach includes integrating sustainability goals into governance 
practices to ensure long-term environmental and social benefits. 
• 
Scope. Open-channel communication proactively calibrates to a project’s evolving needs 
to add elements, adjust quality, or remove elements of the scope or project requirements. 
Sustainability considerations should be embedded into the scope to help ensure that 
project deliverables meet or exceed the organization’s sustainability goals, as well as 
environmental and social standards.

• 
Schedule. Teams can offer ideas to accelerate, slow down, or stop delivery of key project 
activities to maximize the available opportunities. Scheduling decisions consider the 
environmental impacts, aiming to minimize carbon footprints and resource usage. 
• 
Finance. Teams help to reduce or eliminate planned expenditures by adding steps, 
requirements, or restrictions that increase costs or require additional resources. Benefits 
realization occurs by generating and identifying long-term goals, so the project delivers 
the intended identified value. Financial planning includes sustainability investments that 
promote long-term cost savings and environmental benefits. 
• 
Stakeholders. Teams establish, influence, or even define the level and character of 
engagement with stakeholders and the broader organization. Stakeholder engagement 
strategies include sustainability education and collaboration to ensure all parties are 
aligned with the project’s environmental and social goals. 
• 
Resources. Teams restrict or enable access to physical resources in line with project 
requirements; the same applies for people with the skills, knowledge, and experience 
needed to deliver the intended outcomes and promote a learning culture. Resource 
management prioritizes sustainable materials and practices, ensuring minimal 
environmental impact. 
• 
Risk. The team defines the risk thresholds of the project and participates in subsequent risk 
management activities. Risk management includes identifying and mitigating environmental 
and social threats to help ensure the project’s sustainability objectives are met. 
3.8 Build an Empowered Culture 
To develop an empowered project culture, the project environment should promote mutual trust 
among stakeholders and the project team members. There should be full clarity on individual roles, 
responsibilities, team agreements, and guiding processes. These factors enable individuals to work 
together and provide synergistic effects from their interactions, which can enable stakeholders to 
collaborate more effectively and efficiently to drive project success (see Figure 3-9). 
Build an Empowered Culture 
Build an empowered culture 
that fosters proactive 
collaboration and promotes 
unity in shared objectives 
effciently and effectively 
through stakeholders and 
teams with diverse skills, 
knowledge, and experience.  
Stakeholders determine the success of projects.
Stakeholders determine the success of projects. 
Stakeholders and team members on a project are key to 
its success, and they should be empowered across 
many dimensions. 
A collaborative project environment enables stakeholders and 
team members to contribute their ideas and recommendations 
freely and proactively to meet project outcomes. 
Knowing that key stakeholders can highly infuence project 
performance and outcomes, motivated and empowered project 
teams actively engage with them to maximize value delivery.

The Standard for Project Management
3.8.1 Project Impact 
Project stakeholders are influenced by the cultures of the organizations involved in the project and by 
the environment in which they operate. Within these influences, project teams often establish their 
own cultural norms. Project teams have the flexibility to customize their organizational frameworks 
to optimally achieve the intended project goal within such new cultures. 
The principle of Build an Empowered Culture enables successful project execution in the following 
areas: 
• 
Diversity. A diverse project team can enrich the project environment to create a more 
inclusive space by bringing together different perspectives. In a global economy, the project 
team may comprise internal organizational staff, contracted contributors, volunteers, or 
external third parties. Some project team members may also be brought in for a short term 
to work on a specific deliverable. Incorporating these key members into a project team may 
present challenges. However, cultivating a team environment that honors diversity and 
seeks to harness it constructively fosters an atmosphere where conflicts can be managed 
efficiently. 
• 
Process definition. Project teams should define processes that enable the completion of 
tasks and work assignments. Additionally, project teams should engage other stakeholders 
to understand, consider, communicate, and respond to their interests, needs, and opinions. 
• 
Interpersonal skills. Project team members and stakeholders should develop a set of 
interpersonal skills such as initiative, integrity, honesty, collaboration, respect, empathy, 
and confidence. These competencies and perspectives assist teams in adjusting to the tasks 
and one another. Coupled with an active involvement of stakeholders from inception to 
completion, these competencies pave the way for success. 
• 
Knowledge of organizational structures. Being aware of the various configurations and 
relationships among the components of project tasks and organizational procedures is 
important for teams to consider when building an empowered culture. Project teams tailor 
and employ frameworks that facilitate the synchronization of personal contributions within 
project tasks. 
• 
Team agreements. Team agreements represent a set of behavioral parameters and 
working norms that are established by the project team and upheld through individual and 
team commitments. These agreements should be created at the beginning of a project to 
determine the essential norms and practices that facilitate ongoing collaborative success. 
3.8.2 Principle in Action 
To provide an example of the principle of Build an Empowered Culture, consider a project team that 
is facing challenges with stakeholder engagement due to the territorial complexities and diversity of 
the people involved in the project. Building an empowered culture enables stakeholders to be seen 
and included from the project’s inception. This involvement provides stakeholders with guidelines to 
add value and actively participate, contributing to the project’s success. 
Remote and virtual teams face heightened challenges due to varying work styles, time zones, and 
the absence of in-person interaction, which can hinder collaboration and relationship building. 
An empowered culture gives all team members and stakeholders the opportunity to build and 
collaborate in effective and constructive ways, solving differences and managing conflicts proactively.

3.8.3 Connected Performance Domains 
Teams and stakeholders can affect many aspects of a project, including but not limited to the 
following: 
• 
Governance. The project team’s proactive and collaborative approach with the governance 
team develops a positive, transparent communication channel with management, helping 
to ensure alignment with the project objectives and achieve outcomes with the fewest 
deviations and least amount of confusion. 
• 
Scope. Open-channel communication proactively calibrates to a project’s evolving needs 
to add elements, adjust quality, or remove elements of the scope or project and quality 
requirements. 
• 
Schedule. Empowered teams can offer ideas to accelerate, slow down, or stop delivery of 
key project activities to maximize the available opportunities. 
• 
Finance. Empowered teams help to reduce or eliminate unplanned expenditures by 
performing steps, requirements, or restrictions that increase the focus on value creation. 
Benefits realization occurs by generating and identifying long-term goals, so the project 
delivers the intended identified value. 
• 
Stakeholders. Teams establish, influence, or even define the level and character of 
engagement with appropriate stakeholders—both inside and outside the performing 
organization. 
• 
Resources. Teams restrict or enable access to physical resources in line with the project 
requirements; the same applies for people with the skills, knowledge, and experience 
needed to deliver the intended outcomes and promote a learning culture. 
• 
Risk. The team defines the risk thresholds of the project and participates in subsequent risk 
management activities.
