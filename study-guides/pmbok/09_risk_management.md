physical and/or virtual resources. 
The number of materials used, scrap discarded, and amount of 
rework indicate that resources are being used effciently. 
Resource procurement management 
is conducted. 
The procurement processes, effciency checks, order, manufacture, 
and delivery tracking are all successfully managed. 
2.6.5 Check Results 
Activities related to the Resources performance domain should be considered successful only if they 
contribute to specific outcomes. Table 2-10 shows a set of sample target outcomes, along with a 
potential check to confirm whether those outcomes are met. 
2.7 Risk Performance Domain 
The Risk performance domain represents a comprehensive approach to creating project resilience 
by managing risk through risk management practices. The Risk performance domain emphasizes 
the project team’s ability to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and adapt to various risks and 
disruptions, helping ensure continuity and success under varying uncertainties. The Risk performance 
domain advocates for a proactive stance in planning for identified project risks and disruptions, 
coupled with adaptive and flexible response mechanisms in case they occur. 
2.7.1 Key Concepts 
The following key concepts support the effective practices for the Risk performance domain: 
• 
Risk. A risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative 
effect on one or more portfolio, program, or project objectives. Identified risks may or may

not materialize in a portfolio, program, or project. Potentially harmful risks, often called 
threats, may negatively impact one or more project objectives through project delays, 
cost overruns, or reputation damage. Positive risks, better known as opportunities, may 
positively affect one or more project objectives, including a potential increase in market 
share, cost savings, or a positive environmental impact. A risk may be described in a 
“cause, event, and consequence” structure (see the risk register in Section 4 on Inputs and 
Outputs). Risks can also be classified into unknown-known, unknown-unknown, known-
known, and known-unknown (see Figure 2-46). 
• 
Issue. An issue is a current condition or situation that may have an impact on one or 
more project objectives. An issue has already occurred and may require immediate 
action or management attention. Reviewing the project issue log and risk register can 
identify challenges associated with individual stakeholders. Risks and issues may be 
closely related as an issue may arise from a poorly managed risk. However, issues also 
differ from risks as issues have already occurred or are still occurring, whereas risks are 
potential future problems that have not yet occurred. 
• 
Overall risk. Overall risk is the effect of uncertainty on the portfolio, program, or project 
as a whole. Overall risk may arise from everything that is uncertain or unknown in the 
project, including individual risks. Responses to overall project risk are the same as 
for individual threats and opportunities, though responses are applied to the overall 
project rather than to a specific event. If the overall risk to the project is too high, the 
organization may choose to cancel the project. 
Unknown–Known 
Knowledge exists in the 
community but not with the 
entity working on the endeavor. 
(Hidden fact) 
Unknown–Unknown 
Knowledge does not exist 
within the sphere of infuence. 
(Emergent risk) 
Known–Known 
Managed as a part of scope. 
Not a risk. 
(Facts and requirements) 
Known–Unknown 
There is knowledge to identify 
probability and impact.

• 
Risk appetite. Risk appetite is the degree of uncertainty an organization or individual is willing 
to accept in anticipation of a reward. Risk appetite is often quantified through a risk threshold. 
• 
Risk threshold. The risk threshold is the measure of acceptable variation around an 
objective that reflects the risk appetite of the organization and stakeholders (internal and 
external) (e.g., a risk threshold of ±5% around a cost objective reflects a lower risk appetite 
than a risk threshold of ±10%). 
• 
Risk exposure. Risk exposure is an aggregate measure of the potential impact of all risks at 
any given point in time in a portfolio, program, or project. 
• 
Risk response. A risk response is an action, planned or implemented, to address particular 
threats and opportunities. Adequate and appropriate risk responses can minimize 
individual and overall project threats and maximize individual and overall opportunities. 
Types of risk response strategies include opportunity and threat acceptance or escalation, 
opportunity enhancement, opportunity exploiting, opportunity sharing, threat mitigation, 
threat avoidance, and threat transference. 
• 
Project resilience. Resiliency consists of the ability to absorb impacts and recover quickly 
from setbacks or failures. Projects are not immune to unexpected disruptions, effects of 
high-impact and low-probability events (black swan events), or emergent risks, which are 
essentially unknowable within the context of portfolio, program, and project management 
(unknown-unknowns). Incorporating resilience into project management is essential to 
equip projects with the ability to anticipate, respond to, and recover from unexpected 
disruptions. Embedding resilience ensures projects are robust enough to maintain 
continuity and minimize the impact of adverse events. Reserve analysis is often related to 
establishing project resilience (see Section 5 on Tools and Techniques). 
• 
Ambiguity and uncertainty. Ambiguity is a state of being unclear, of not knowing what to 
expect or how to comprehend a situation. Ambiguity can arise from having many options 
or a lack of clarity on the optimal choice. Unclear or misleading events, emerging issues, or 
subjective situations can also lead to ambiguity. Uncertainty is the lack of understanding 
and awareness of issues, events, paths to follow, or solutions to pursue. Uncertainty 
deals with the probabilities of alternative actions, reactions, and outcomes. Uncertainty 
includes emerging factors that are completely outside of existing knowledge or experience. 
Ambiguous and uncertain situations do not always escalate into risks. As more information 
becomes available and subject matter experts get involved, these situations can often be 
resolved through a collaborative problem-solving process. 
2.7.2 Processes 
The Risk performance domain includes the processes required to conduct risk management 
planning, identification, analysis, response planning, response implementation, and risk reviews on 
a project. The objectives of this performance domain are to increase the probability and impact of 
positive risks while decreasing the probability and impact of negative risks. This approach accelerates 
project resilience, reduces uncertainty, and increases the chances of project success. 
The following processes are included in the Risk performance domain (see Figure 2-47): 
• 
Plan Risk Management. The process of outlining how to conduct risk activities early in the 
project, starting at project conception.

Identify Risks. The process of identifying project threats and opportunities. An important 
part of the Identify Risks process is separating real risks from concerns, knowing initial 
identification is incomplete. Iterative identification adapts to new information as the project 
progresses. 
• 
Perform Risk Analysis. The process of analyzing risks using an iterative approach that 
may combine qualitative and quantitative risk analyses. Qualitative analysis evaluates risks 
based on their probability and impact throughout the project. Quantitative analysis, when 
required, assesses the combined effect of risks and uncertainties on project objectives. 
• 
Plan Risk Responses. The process of developing suitable and effective responses to 
manage overall project and individual risks, which is performed throughout the project. 
• Implement Risk Responses. The process of executing risk plans to address project risks, 
minimize threats, and maximize opportunities. 
• 
Monitor Risks. The process of tracking and analyzing risks, implementing response plans, 
and evaluating their effectiveness throughout the project, ensuring continuity and effective 
risk management. 
2.7.2.1 Plan Risk Management 
Plan Risk Management defines how to conduct risk management activities for a project. The 
process should begin when a project is conceived and should be completed early in the project. Risk 
management activities and tools are a key element of this process (see Figure 2-48).

2.7.2.2 Identify Risks 
Identify Risks includes recognizing both negative and positive risks. The process of risk identification 
focuses on distinguishing genuine risks from nonrisks, such as concerns and issues. It is important 
to recognize that not all risks can be identified at the outset due to the inherent uncertainties and 
unknowns present at the beginning of a project. Therefore, risk identification should be an iterative 
process, allowing for continuous identification and assessment of risks as more information becomes 
available and the project evolves. This iterative approach helps ensure that the risk management 
process remains dynamic and responsive, addressing emerging risks effectively and to a practical 
extent throughout the project life cycle (see Figure 2-49). 
2.7.2.3 Perform Risk Analysis 
Perform Risk Analysis involves an iterative process that combines both qualitative and quantitative 
risk analysis actions. Qualitative risk analysis is conducted throughout the project to evaluate 
individual project risks by assessing their probability of occurrence and impact. Other characteristics 
of assessment may include the degree of impact on the objectives, manageability, timing of 
possible impacts, relationships with other risks, and common causes or effects. Quantitative risk 
analysis, depending on the project, may not always be required, but when it is, it is also conducted 
throughout the project. This process includes numerically analyzing the combined effect of 
identified individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty on overall project objectives (see 
Figure 2-50). 
2.7.2.4 Plan Risk Responses 
Plan Risk Responses is the process of developing options, selecting strategies, and agreeing on 
actions to address overall project risk exposure, as well as to treat individual project risks. The key 
benefit of this process is that it identifies suitable ways to address overall project risk and individual

project risks. This process also allocates resources or includes reserves (see the Finance performance 
domain in Section 2.4) and inserts activities into project documents and the project management 
plan as needed. The risk responses for threats and opportunities are listed in Section 5 on Tools 
and Techniques (see contingent response strategies, strategies for managing threats, strategies for 
managing opportunities, and strategies for managing overall project risk). This process should be 
performed throughout the project (see Figure 2-51).

2.7.2.5 Implement Risk Responses 
Implement Risk Responses is the process of implementing sufficient risk response plans. The key 
benefit of this process is that it ensures that agreed-upon risk responses are executed as planned to 
address overall project risk exposure, minimize individual project threats, and maximize individual 
project opportunities (see Figure 2-52). 
2.7.2.6 Monitor Risks 
Monitor Risks is the process of monitoring the implementation of risk response plans, tracking 
identified risks, identifying and analyzing new risks, planning responses for new risks, and evaluating the 
effectiveness of risk responses and processes throughout the project. This process helps ensure that risk 
owners are assigned to maintain continuity and address emerging risks effectively (see Figure 2-53). 
2.7.3 Tailoring Considerations 
Because each project is unique, activities and processes in the Risk performance domain should be 
tailored. Considerations for tailoring may include the following: 
• 
Project size and complexity. Determine if the project’s size or complexity necessitates a 
more detailed risk management approach or if a simplified process suffices. Constraints

viewed across various project domains like schedule, budget, scope, and stakeholders. 
• 
Strategic importance. Evaluate the project’s strategic importance and its associated risk 
level due to breakthrough opportunities, performance blocks, or major innovations. 
• 
Development approach. Identify if the project follows a predictive, adaptive, or hybrid 
approach to appropriately tailor the risk processes. 
• 
Planning and implementing risk responses with flexibility. Manage risk responses by 
allowing for timely adjustments to risk strategies without compromising project goals and 
maintain open communication with relevant stakeholders.

• 
Exploring complementary techniques in risk identification and analysis. Utilize 
advanced techniques like generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and data analytics for 
comprehensive risk identification and analysis. 
• 
Necessity for resilience planning. Prepare for major disruptions with scenario planning 
and ensure alignment with the organization’s business continuity or emergency response 
plan. 
2.7.3.1 Examples 
The following are two examples of how these considerations might be applied: 
• 
Example 1. A renewable energy project team may focus on large-scale solar power plant 
construction to meet a company’s sustainability objectives. The risk management process 
should be tailored to include specific actions to significantly advance the organization’s 
green energy initiatives and market position. This customization involves regular meetings 
with key stakeholders to address their concerns and collect feedback. Additionally, 
conducting regular risk assessments allows for timely identification of potential threats 
and opportunities and the formulation of suitable risk responses. Appointing dedicated 
risk managers who utilize advanced simulation models aids in forecasting and mitigating 
potential risks. 
• 
Example 2. A project with an agile life cycle may involve developing a new software 
application to meet rapidly changing market demands. Thus, to tailor risk management for 
this development approach, the project team conducts risk assessments at the beginning 
of each sprint instead of only during the initial planning phase. This adjustment allows the 
team to quickly identify and address emerging risks, ensuring flexibility and responsiveness. 
Additionally, regular risk review meetings are held with stakeholders at the end of each 
iteration to incorporate their feedback and adjust risk strategies accordingly. The frequent, 
iterative risk management process and risk-adjusted backlogs help maintain alignment with 
the project’s dynamic requirements and stakeholder expectations. 
2.7.4 Interactions With Other Domains 
The Risk performance domain is closely interrelated with the Scope, Schedule, Finance, and 
Stakeholders performance domains. 
Stakeholders are critical sources of information regarding risks and uncertainty. They provide insights 
about potential risks, suggest risk assessment methods, and assist in managing uncertainties. 
Effective stakeholder engagement and communication can help ensure that risk management 
processes align with stakeholder expectations and can assist with proactively addressing concerns. 
The Scope, Schedule, and Finance performance domains are also crucial areas of interaction. In 
predictive projects with stable scopes, schedule reserves help manage identified risks and maintain 
timelines. In adaptive projects with evolving requirements, the team should adjust plans to address 
new risks and uncertainties. Risks can impact the project scope, either increasing or decreasing it, 
which in turn affects the schedule and budget. Additionally, the Finance performance domain is 
directly influenced by risk management, with internal projects experiencing increased or decreased 
costs, and external projects facing potential revenue generation or loss. Effective risk management

requires integrating scope management, schedule planning, financial considerations, stakeholder 
engagement, and communication to help ensure tailored and comprehensive risk response 
strategies. 
2.7.5 Check Results 
Activities in the Risk performance domain are considered successful when they contribute to specific 
outcomes. Table 2-11 shows a set of sample target outcomes, along with a potential check to confirm 
whether those outcomes are met.

There is an awareness of the environment 
in which projects occur, including techni-
cal, social, political, market, and eco-
nomic contexts. 
The team incorporates environmental considerations when 
evaluating uncertainty, risks, and responses. 
The project team proactively explores and 
responds to uncertainty. 
Risk responses are aligned with project constraints such as 
budget, schedule, and performance. 
The project team has the capacity to anti-
cipate threats and opportunities and un-
derstands the consequences of issues. 
A process is in place, and well understood by the project team, 
for identifying, assessing, documenting, and responding to 
risks. 
Project delivery is achieved with minimal 
negative impact from unknown events or 
conditions. 
Reserves are in place and utilized, scheduled delivery dates 
are met, and the budget performance is within the variance 
threshold. 
Opportunities to improve project perfor-
mance and outcomes are realized. 
Project teams use established mechanisms to identify, 
leverage, and track the realization of opportunities. 
Project contingency reserves are used 
effectively to maintain alignment with 
project objectives. 
Project teams take steps to proactively prevent threats, 
thereby limiting the use of project contingency reserves. 
Resilience and the ability to recover 
quickly from setbacks are being devel-
oped throughout the project. 
The project team is aware of the larger organization’s business 
continuity plan or emergency response plan. Where applicable, 
a project continuity plan is developed. A management reserve 
is available to cover unknown risks. 
During times of crisis, the project team can quickly adjust its 
structure and processes to adapt to new constraints.
